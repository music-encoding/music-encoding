# Curated List of Contributors

The file _curated.contributors.json_ is used to provide additional information about contributors to the MEI Guidelines and Specification. When generating the PDF version of the Guidelines, a list of all contributors to the `/music-encoding/music-encoding` and `/music-encoding/guidelines` repositories is loaded from GitHub and compiled to a format similar to the one found in this document. It is then compared to and enriched with the information found here. The purpose of this file is to

* give clear names of contributors where they're not available from GitHub
* provide additional information like [ORCID IDs](https://orcid.org/)
* suppress bot users

The supposed workflow is to make contributions to MEI as usual. If you're new to MEI and your information isn't contained in this file yet, you are invited to open a Pull Request with the details necessary for this file. If you would like some assistance with this, just reach out to the MEI Technical Co-Chairs. It is their responsibility to update this list before an upcoming MEI release.
