               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p>Metadata means "data about data", <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, information about various aspects of an encoding at hand. There are many different types of metadata, which MEI tries to order according to their respective scope or perspective, as described in <ptr target="#headerstructure"/>. MEI’s approach to metadata is heavily influenced by other existing standards and models, such as TEI, MARC, and FRBR. It attempts to reflect both current library practice and common scholarly methods, for example in the field of source descriptions (see chapter <ptr target="#msdesc"/>).</p>
               <p>This chapter thus addresses the description of an encoded item so that the musical text, as well as its sources, encoding, and revisions are all thoroughly documented. Such documentation is necessary for scholars using the texts, for software processing them, and for catalogers in libraries and archives. Together these descriptions and declarations provide an electronic analog to the title page attached to a printed work. They also constitute an equivalent for the content of the code books or introductory manuals customarily accompanying electronic data sets.</p>
               <p>For large encoding projects, the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (<abbr>FRBR</abbr>) capabilities of MEI provides most flexibility and descriptive capabilities. However, MEI also provides simpler, non-FRBR methods for source description for those cases where the FRBR capbilities are not needed. These are further discussed in <ptr target="nonfrbrsourcedescription" />./></p>

            <div xml:id="headerstructure" type="div2">
               <head>Structure of the MEI Header</head>
               <p>Every MEI-conformant text not embedded in another XML carrier that provides for capturing metadata, such as TEI or METS, must carry a set of descriptions, prefixed to it and encoded as described in this chapter. This set is known as the MEI header, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>.</p>
               <p>The metadata encoded inside <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> covers a number of different use cases. Some child elements like <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> may appear in various places (see <ptr target="#headerTitleStatement"/>), so it is important to understand the roles of the different areas of the MEI header. These areas are described following their order of appearance within the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>Zero or more <hi rend="italic">alternative identifiers</hi>, tagged with <gi scheme="MEI">altId</gi>, each of which provides an identifying name or number associated with the file. This is just a simple element that helps to preserve other external identifiers for a file, such as database keys.</item>
                  <item>A <hi rend="italic">file description</hi>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi>, containing a full bibliographic description of the computer file itself. From the information contained here, a user of the encoding should be able to derive a proper bibliographic citation, and a librarian or archivist could use it for creating a catalog entry recording its presence within a library or archive. A <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> within <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> captures the <hi rend="italic">title of the file</hi>, which may be different than the <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> of the encoded <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, or the title given on any of the <hi rend="italic">sources</hi> used to generate the file. The term <hi rend="italic">computer file</hi> here is to be understood as referring to the whole intellectual entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in multiple physical operating system files. The file description also includes information about the <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> or sources from which the electronic document was derived (not to be confused with sources that represent or witness the encoded work in a more general sense; these may be described within the <gi scheme="MEI">manifestationList</gi> element).</item>
                  <item>The MEI elements used to encode the file description are described in section <ptr target="#meifile"/>.</item>
                  <item>An optional <hi rend="italic">encoding description</hi>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">encodingDesc</gi>, which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied, and similar matters.</item>
                  <item>The MEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in section <ptr target="#headerEncodingDescription"/>.</item>
                  <item>An optional <hi rend="italic">work description</hi> or list of the works encoded or described in the file, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">workList</gi>, containing classification and contextual information about the work(s), such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth. Such a work profile is of particular use in highly structured composite texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin. The work description may however be of use in any form of automatic text processing.</item>
                  <item>The MEI elements used to encode the work description are described in section <ptr target="#headerWorkDescription"/>.</item>
                  <item>An optional list of manifestations of the work, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">manifestationList</gi>, containing descriptions of <hi rend="italic">sources</hi> ("manifestations" in <ptr target="#FRBR"/> terms) that represent or witness the encoded work in some way, regardless of whether the encoding is based on these sources or not; for instance, it is useful for listing all known sources to a particular work in a cataloging project or a critical edition.</item>
                  <item>The MEI elements used to encode the source description are described in section <ptr target="#msdesc"/>.</item>
                  <item>Zero or more elements tagged <gi scheme="MEI">extMeta</gi>, containing <hi rend="italic">non-MEI metadata</hi>.</item>
                  <item>This concept is covered in section <ptr target="#headerusecases"/>.</item>
                  <item>A <hi rend="italic">revision history</hi>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">revisionDesc</gi>, which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic text. The revision history is important for version control and for resolving questions about the history of a file. The MEI elements used to encode the revision description are described in section <ptr target="#headerRevisionDescription"/>.</item>

                  <head>Non-FRBR Source Description</head>
                  <p>MEI allows two methodologies to be used when doing metadata capture and source description. The <abbr>FRBR</abbr> methodology, described later in this chapter, gives encoders a mechanism for building detailed descriptions of bibliographic entities. Most bibliographic-based projects should favor the FRBR method.</p>
                  <p>However, there are cases where detailed bibliographic analysis at the level required by the FRBR module is not possible or desirable. These may include situations such as retro-conversion of non-FRBR catalogues, or capturing the output of notation encoding software where only minimal source description capabilities are available. In these cases, encoders may capture metadata in the MEI header without using FRBR encoding entities and instead choose a simplified methodology for source description.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> element as a child of the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element may be used to capture simple bibliographic descriptions. An example is given below.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element contains the chief name of the electronic work. Its content takes the form considered appropriate by its creator. The element may be repeated, if the work has more than one title (perhaps in different languages). Where the electronic work is derived from an existing source text, it is strongly recommended that the title for the former should be derived from the latter, but clearly distinguishable from it, for example by the addition of a phrase such as ‘: an electronic transcription’ or ‘a digital edition’. This will distinguish the electronic work from the source text in citations and in catalogs, which contain descriptions of both types of material.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample020.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other alternative titles or subtitles may be encoded in additional title elements with values in the <att>type</att> attribute that distinguish them from the chief title. Sample values for the <att>type</att> attribute include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective title).</p>
                  <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for convenience in analyzing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element, as in the following example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample021.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>The electronic work will also have an external name (its ‘filename’ or ‘data set name’) or reference number on the computer system where it resides at any time. This name is likely to change frequently, as new copies of the file are made on the computer system. Its form is entirely dependent on the particular computer system in use and thus cannot always easily be transferred from one system to another. Moreover, a given work may be composed of many files. For these reasons, these Guidelines strongly recommend that such names should not be used as the title for any electronic work.</p>
                  <p>Helpful guidance on the formulation of useful descriptive titles in difficult cases may be found in the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (Gorman and Winkler, 1978, chapter 25) or in equivalent national-level bibliographical documentation.</p>
                  <p>It is important to keep in mind that the <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> element provides <hi rend="italic">structured</hi> metadata. Preserving the exact rendition of a title page is possible using the <gi scheme="MEI">titlePage</gi> element (see <ptr target="#textTitlePages"/>).</p>
                  <p>The title of a <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi> is given by using the <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element directly, as many other child elements of <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> are available on work directly.</p>

                  <p>At a minimum, the creator of the musical text and the creator of the file should be identified.

Optionally also include the names of others involved in the transcription or elaboration of the text, sponsors, and funding agencies. The name of the person responsible for physical data input need not normally be recorded, unless that person is also intellectually responsible for some aspect of the creation of the file.</p>
                  <p>In traditional bibliographic practice, those with primary creative responsibility are given special prominence. MEI accommodates this approach by providing responsibility-role elements. For example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample022.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondary intellectual responsibility in this case is encoded using <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> element has two subcomponents: a <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi> element identifying a responsible individual or organization, and a <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi> element indicating the nature of the responsibility. All names should be stated in the form in which the persons or bodies wish to be publicly cited. This will usually be the fullest form of the name, including first names. No specific recommendations are made at this time as to appropriate content for <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi>. However, it should make clear the nature of the responsibility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample023.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>This method of encoding facilitates exchange of bibliographic data with library catalogs and bibliographic databases as well as applications whose handling of bibliographic data is restricted to traditional responsibility roles. Additional information regarding these responsibility-role elements can be found in chapter <ptr target="#sharedBibliographicCitations"/>.</p>
                  <p>When the MEI.namesdates module is enabled, two additional elements are also permitted within <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi>:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="corpName"/>
                        <specDesc key="persName"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>These elements allow for more precise identification of the entity associated with the name than is permitted by the simpler <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi> element. The following example shows how a precise date range can be associated with a personal or corporate name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample024.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>For additional information about corporate and personal names, see chapter <ptr target="#sharedNames"/>.</p>
                  <p>In addition to, or instead of the <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi> element, the <att>role</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">persName</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">corpName</gi> may be used to capture the nature of responsibility. While <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi> accommodates capturing the wide variety of text that may occur in responsibility statements, use of the <att>role</att> attribute provides the possibility of recording a controlled value independently of the textual content of <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>

                  </p>
                  <p>Values from the MARC relator code list (<ref target="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html</ref>) or term list (<ref target="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html</ref>) are recommended for <att>role</att>, where applicable.</p>
                  <p>Where it is necessary to group responsibilities and names, multiple responsibility statements may be used. For example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample026.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is often desirable to mix primary and secondary intellectual responsibility information. Treating all intellectual roles the same way can allow literal transcription of existing responsibility statements and simplify programmatic processing. The following example demonstrates how a responsibility statement may be transcribed using interleaved <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">persName</gi> elements:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample027.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, eliminating explanatory text and relying on standardized values for <att>role</att>, as in the following example, allows data creation and processing tools of the greatest simplicity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>

                  <head>File Description</head>
                  <p>The structure of the bibliographic description of a machine-readable or digital musical text resembles that of a book, an article, or other kinds of textual objects. The file description element of the MEI header has therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library cataloging; it should thus provide enough information to allow users to give standard bibliographic references to the electronic text, and to allow catalogers to catalog it. Bibliographic citations occurring elsewhere in the header, and in the text itself, are derived from the same model.</p>
                  <p>The bibliographic description of an electronic musical text should be supplied by the mandatory <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element contains two mandatory and six optional elements, each of which is described in more detail below. These elements are listed below in the order in which they must occur within the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>

                     <head>Edition Statement</head>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">editionStmt</gi> element is the second component of the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element, following the mandatory <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi>. It is optional but recommended when applicable.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It contains elements for identifying the edition and those responsible for it:</p>
                     <p>
                        <specList>
                           <specDesc key="edition"/>
                           <specDesc key="respStmt"/>
                        </specList>
                     </p>
                     <p>For printed texts, the term ‘edition’ applies to the set of all the identical copies of an item produced from one master copy and issued by a particular publishing agency or a group of such agencies. A change in the identity of the distributing body or bodies does not normally constitute a change of edition, while a change in the master copy does.</p>
                     <p>For electronic texts, the notion of a master copy is not entirely appropriate, since they are far more easily copied and modified than printed ones; nonetheless, the term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which substantive changes are made and fixed. Synonymous terms used in these Guidelines are version, level, and release. The words revision and update, by contrast, are used for minor changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition.</p>
                     <p>No simple rule can specify how substantive changes have to be before they are regarded as producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. The addition of analytic coding to a text would thus constitute a new edition, while automatic conversion from one coded representation to another would not. Changes relating to the character code or physical storage details, corrections of misspellings, simple changes in the arrangement of the contents and changes in the output format do not normally constitute a new edition, whereas the addition of new information (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, annotations, sound or images, links to external data) almost always does.</p>
                     <p>Clearly, there will always be borderline cases and the matter is somewhat arbitrary. The simplest rule is: if you think that your file is a new edition, then call it such. An edition statement is optional for the first release of a computer file; it is mandatory for each later release, though this requirement cannot be enforced.</p>
                     <p>Note that all changes in a file, whether or not they are regarded as constituting a new edition or simply a revision, should be independently noted in the revision description section of the file header (see section <ptr target="#headerRevisionDescription"/>).</p>
                     <p>The edition element should contain phrases describing the edition or version, including the word 'edition', 'version', or an equivalent term, together with a number or date, or terms indicating difference from other editions such as 'new edition', 'revised edition', etc. Any dates that occur within the edition statement should be marked with the <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi> element. The <att>n</att> attribute of the edition element may be used as elsewhere to supply any formal identification (such as a version number) for the edition.</p>
                     <p>One or more <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> elements may also be used to supply statements of responsibility for the edition in question. These may refer to individuals or corporate bodies and can indicate functions such as that of a reviser, or can name the person or body responsible for the provision of supplementary matter, of appendices, etc., in a new edition.</p>
                     <p>Some examples follow:</p>

                     <head>Extent of the File</head>
                     <p>The third component of the fileDesc is a description of the physical qualities of the file. The <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> element is provided for this purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <specList>
                           <specDesc key="extent"/>
                        </specList>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> element describes the approximate size of a text as stored on some carrier medium, whether digital or non-digital, specified in any convenient units.</p>
                     <p>For printed books, information about the carrier, such as the kind of medium used and its size, are of great importance in cataloging procedures. The print-oriented rules for bibliographic description of an item’s medium and extent need some re-interpretation when applied to electronic media. An electronic file exists as a distinct entity quite independently of its carrier and remains the same intellectual object whether it is stored as file on a hard disc drive, a CD-ROM, a set of USB devices, or in the internet. Since, moreover, these Guidelines are specifically aimed at facilitating transparent document storage and interchange, any purely machine-dependent information should be irrelevant as far as the file header is concerned.</p>
                     <p>This is particularly true of information about file-type although library-oriented rules for cataloging often distinguish two types of computer file: ‘data’ and ‘programs’. This distinction is quite difficult to draw in some cases, for example, hypermedia or texts with built-in search and retrieval software.</p>
                     <p>Although it is equally system-dependent, some measure of the size of the computer file may be of use for cataloging and other practical purposes. Because the measurement and expression of file size is fraught with difficulties, only very general recommendations are possible; the element <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> should contain a phrase indicating the size or approximate size of the computer file in one of the following ways:</p>
                     <list rend="bulleted">
                        <item>in bytes of a specified length (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, ‘4000 bytes’)</item>
                        <item>as falling within a range of values, for example:</item>
                        <item>less than 1 Mb</item>
                        <item>between 1 Mb and 5 Mb</item>
                        <item>between 6 Mb and 10 Mb</item>
                        <item>over 10 Mb</item>
                        <item>in terms of any convenient logical units (for example, words or sentences, citations, paragraphs)</item>
                        <item>in terms of any convenient physical units (for example, compact discs, removable hard drives, DVDs)</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The use of standard abbreviations for units of quantity is recommended where applicable, here as elsewhere (see <ref target="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html</ref>).</p>

                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element is the sixth component of the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element and is optional.

                        <item>the nature, scope, artistic form, or purpose of the work; also the genre or other intellectual category to which it may belong. These should be formally described within the <gi scheme="MEI">workList</gi> element (section <ptr target="#headerWorkDescription"/>).</item>
                        <item>bibliographic details relating to the source or sources of an electronic text: <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, ‘Transcribed from a facsimile of the 1743 publication’. These should be formally described in the <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> element (section <ptr target="#headerSourceDescription"/>).</item>
                        <item>further information relating to publication, distribution, or release of the text, including sources from which the text may be obtained, any restrictions on its use or formal terms on its availability. These should be placed in the appropriate division of the <gi scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi> element (section <ptr target="#headerPublicationDistribution"/>).</item>
                        <item>publicly documented numbers associated <hi rend="italic">with the file</hi> should be placed in an <gi scheme="MEI">altId</gi> element within the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element. International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN), International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), and other internationally agreed upon standard numbers that uniquely identify an item, should be treated in the same way, rather than as specialized bibliographic notes. As described elsewhere, identifiers <hi rend="italic">for sources of the file</hi> should be recorded within the <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi>.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Nevertheless, the <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element may be used to record potentially significant details about the file and its features, for example:</p>
                     <list rend="bulleted">
                        <item>dates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the computer file: <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, ‘manual dated 2010’, ‘file validated Apr 2011’</item>
                        <item>names of persons or bodies connected with the technical production, administration, or consulting functions of the effort which produced the file, if these are not named in statements of responsibility in the title or edition statements of the file description: <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, ‘Historical commentary provided by members of the Big Symphony Orchestra’</item>
                        <item>availability of the file in an additional medium or information not already recorded about the availability of documentation: <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, ‘User manual is loose-leaf in eleven paginated sections’</item>
                        <item>language of work and abstract, if not encoded in the <gi scheme="MEI">langUsage</gi> element, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, ‘Text in English with stage directions in French and German’</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Each such item of information may be tagged using the general-purpose <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> element. Groups of annotations are contained within the <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element, as in the following example:</p>

                     <p>There are advantages, however, to encoding such information with more precise elements elsewhere in the MEI header, when such elements are available. For example, the notes above might be encoded as follows:</p>

                     <p>It is sometimes convenient to store information relating to the processing of an encoded resource within its header. Typical uses for such information might be:</p>
                     <list rend="bulleted">
                        <item>to allow an application to discover that it has previously opened or edited a file, and what version of itself was used to do that;</item>
                        <item>to show (through a date) which application last edited the file to allow for diagnosis of any problems that might have been caused by that application;</item>
                        <item>to allow users to discover information about an application used to edit the file</item>
                        <item>to allow the application to declare an interest in elements of the file which it has edited, so that other applications or human editors may be more wary of making changes to those sections of the file.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>
                        <specList>
                           <specDesc key="application"/>
                           <specDesc key="application" atts="version"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>Each <gi scheme="MEI">application</gi> element identifies the current state of one software application with regard to the current file. This element is a member of the att.datable class, which provides a variety of attributes for associating this state with a date and time, or a temporal range. The <att>xml:id</att> and <att>version</att> attributes should be used to uniquely identify the application and its major version number (for example, 'Music Markup Tool 1.5'). It is not intended that a software application should add a new <gi scheme="MEI">application</gi> element each time it touches the file.</p>
                     <p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to record the fact that version 1.5 of an application called ‘Music Markup Tool’ has an interest in two parts of a document. The parts concerned are accessible at the URLs given as targets of the two <gi scheme="MEI">ptr</gi> elements. When used on <gi scheme="MEI">application</gi>, the <att>date</att> attribute specifies when the application was employed, in this case June 6, 2011. Version information for the application should be placed in <att>version</att>.</p>

                        <label>correction</label>
                        <item>States how and under what circumstances corrections have been made in the text. corrlevelIndicates the degree of correction applied to the text. methodIndicates the method employed to mark corrections and normalizations. Was the text corrected during or after data capture? If so, were corrections made silently or are they marked using the tags described in chapter 11 Editorial Markup? What principles have been adopted with respect to omissions, truncations, dubious corrections, alternate readings, false starts, repetitions, etc.?</item>
                        <label>interpretation</label>
                        <item>Describes the scope of any analytic or interpretive information added to the transcription of the music. Has any analytic or ‘interpretive’ information been provided — that is, information which is felt to be non-obvious, or potentially contentious? If so, how was it generated? How was it encoded?</item>
                        <label>normalization</label>
                        <item>Indicates the extent of normalization or regularization of the original source carried out in converting it to electronic form. methodIndicates the method employed to mark corrections and normalizations. Was the text normalized, for example by regularizing any non-standard enharmonic spellings, etc.? If so, were normalizations performed silently or are they marked using the tags described in chapter 11 Editorial Markup ? What authority was used for the regularization? Also, what principles were used when normalizing numbers to provide the standard values for the value attribute described in section 1.3.4 Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses and what format is used for them?</item>
                        <label>segmentation</label>
                        <item>Describes the principles according to which the musical text has been segmented, for example into movements, sections, etc. How is the musical text segmented? If mdiv and/or section elements have been used to partition the music for analysis, how are they marked and how was the segmentation arrived at?</item>
                        <label>stdVals (standard values)</label>
                        <item>Specifies the format used when standardized date or number values are supplied. In most cases, attributes bearing standardized values should conform to a defineddatatype. In cases where this is not appropriate, this element may be used to describe the standardization methods underlying the values supplied.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Experience shows that a full record should be kept of decisions relating to editorial principles and encoding practice, both for future users of the text and for the project which produced the text in the first instance. Any information about the editorial principles applied not falling under one of the above headings may be recorded as additional prose following the special-use elements.</p>

                  <p>The final sub-element of the MEI header, the <gi scheme="MEI">revisionDesc</gi> element, provides a detailed change log in which each change made to a text may be recorded. Its use is optional but highly recommended. It provides essential information for the administration of large numbers of files which are being updated, corrected, or otherwise modified as well as extremely useful documentation for files being passed from researcher to researcher or system to system. Without change logs, it is easy to confuse different versions of a file, or to remain unaware of small but important changes made in the file by some earlier link in the chain of distribution. No change should be made in any MEI-conformant file without corresponding entries being made in the change log.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The main purpose of the revision description is to record changes in the text to which a header is prefixed. However, it is recommended practice to include entries also for significant changes in the header itself (other than the revision description itself, of course). At the very least, an entry should be supplied indicating the date of creation of the header.</p>
                  <p>The log consists of a list of <gi scheme="MEI">change</gi> elements, each of which contains a detailed description of the changes made. If a number is to be associated with one or more changes (for example, a revision number), the <att>n</att> attribute may be used to indicate it. The person responsible for the change and the date of the change may be indicated by the <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi> elements. The description of the change itself is contained within the <gi scheme="MEI">changeDesc</gi> element, which can hold one or more paragraphs.</p>
                  <p>It is recommended to give changes in reverse chronological order, most recent first.</p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A slightly shorter form for recording changes is also available when a the date of the change can be described by a single date in a standard ISO form and when the name of the agent(s) responsible for the change, encoded elsewhere in the header, can be referred to by one or more URIs given in the <att>resp</att> attribute. For example:</p>

               <head>Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)</head>
               <p>MEI header information may refer to different levels of description of the encoded work: Some information may apply the work in all its various forms and realizations, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, the name of its composer. Other information may describe a certain version of the work, or a source such as the printed first edition, or only a single copy of that source. Core MEI limits the header information to two such levels of description: work and source, respectively.</p>
               <p>However, when the FRBR module is available more detailed descriptions are possible. With certain limitations, mainly due to the musical nature of the works encoded in MEI, the FRBR module adapts the <ref target="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/123456789/811">Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)</ref> as recommended by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).</p>
               <p>The IFLA’s FRBR model distinguishes four levels of abstraction, or entities:</p>
               <list type="gloss">
                  <label>Work</label>
                  <item>FRBR defines a work as a "distinct intellectual or artistic creation", an abstract entity because there is no single material object one can point to as the work.</item>
                  <label>Expression</label>
                  <item>An expression is defined as "the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in the form of [...] notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such forms". Expressions are also abstract entities.</item>
                  <label>Manifestation</label>
                  <item>A manifestation is defined as "the physical embodiment of an expression of a work", including, for instance, manuscripts, books, sound recordings, films, video recordings, CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. The manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, with respect to both intellectual content and physical form.</item>
                  <label>Item</label>
                  <item>A single exemplar of a manifestation is called an item, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, a specific copy of a printed score. With manuscripts, item and manifestation levels are nearly identical. A manuscript may be regarded as a manifestation having only one item.</item>

                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="work"/>
                        <specDesc key="expression"/>
                        <specDesc key="manifestation"/>
                        <specDesc key="item"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>The names of the MEI entities follow those of FRBR: the <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi> element is a container for description at the FRBR "work" level, <gi scheme="MEI">expression</gi> is for description at the FRBR "expression" level, <gi scheme="MEI">manifestation</gi> contains "manifestation" level description, and <gi scheme="MEI">item</gi> holds FRBR "item" level description. Please note: Until MEI 3.0.0, the <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> element in <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> was used for manifestation-level descriptions.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi> element has an optional child element to hold the expression elements:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="expressionList"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <gi scheme="MEI">expressionList</gi> is a container element for descriptions of different expressions of the same work, it may contain only</p>
                  <p>
                     <gi scheme="MEI">expression</gi> elements.</p>
                  <p>The content model of <gi scheme="MEI">expression</gi> is similar to that of <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi>. It does not, however, permit <gi scheme="MEI">expressionList</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">audience</gi> elements. But it adds elements that aid identification and description of specific versions of a work:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="extent"/>
                        <specDesc key="scoreFormat"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since expressions, like works, are abstractions, their titles are often nebulous. Usually, however, the title of an expression is the same as the work it represents. When the relationship between a work and an expression is encoded hierarchically, the expression’s title element may be omitted with the assumption that it will be inherited from the work. If no title is provided for an expression, distinguishing characteristics must be provided in other elements, such as <gi scheme="MEI">perfMedium</gi>, as in the following example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/FRBR/FRBR-sample080.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Programmatic concatenation of the work title and one or more characteristics of the expression can be used to provide identification for the expression. For example, the expressions above may be identified by "Pavane pour une infante défunte (piano)" and "Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestra)". In some cases, it may be helpful to assign a descriptive title to the expression, as illustrated below. The carrier of the manifestation is often a good source of this kind of descriptive text.</p>

                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">manifestationList</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">manifestation</gi> elements are discussed in section <ptr target="#msdesc"/>.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">itemList</gi> element provides functionality similar to that of <gi scheme="MEI">expressionList</gi>; that is, it can be used to group descriptions of individual items (exemplars) of the parent source. Just like <gi scheme="MEI">expressionList</gi>, which can only hold <gi scheme="MEI">expression</gi> sub-components, <gi scheme="MEI">itemList</gi> may only contain <gi scheme="MEI">item</gi> elements.</p>

                  <head>Component Parts in FRBR</head>
                  <p>Each of the four MEI elements corresponding to FRBR entities may contain a list of constituent parts. All four entities utilize the same element:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="componentList"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the child elements of a component group must be the same type as the group’s parent. This allows for a more detailed description than is possible using the core MEI <gi scheme="MEI">contents</gi> element. For example, a work element’s <gi scheme="MEI">componentList</gi> element can only contain <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi> elements, etc. In this way, the <gi scheme="MEI">componentList</gi> element may be employed to describe composite works, as in the example below:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>

                  </p>
                  <p>This technique can also be applied when a single intellectual source is comprised of multiple physical parts. In the following example, the choral parts were published in four physically separate "signatures":</p>

                  <head>FRBR Relationships</head>
                  <p>FRBR defines a number of terms that describe how the basic entities relate to each other. MEI provides the following elements for this purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="relationList"/>
                        <specDesc key="relation"/>
                        <specDesc key="relation" atts="rel"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>Each of the four FRBR entity equivalents – the work, expression, source, and item elements – allows a list of such relationship descriptions as its last child element. <gi scheme="MEI">relationList</gi> provides a container for individual <gi scheme="MEI">relation</gi> elements. The nature of the relationship must be specified by the <att>rel</att> attribute and the target of the relationship must be identified by the <att>target</att> attribute. The values allowed by <att>rel</att> follow those defined for FRBR at <ref target="http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/frbr/frbr_2008.pdf">http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/frbr/frbr_2008.pdf</ref>.</p>
                  <p>Since relations are bidirectional, they may be defined on both entities involved, using pairs of oppositely-directed relation descriptors. The following FRBR relations are allowed in MEI as values of the relation element’s <att>rel</att> attribute (shown in pairs for clarity):</p>
                  <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>hasAbridgement / isAbridgementOf</item>
                     <item>hasAdaptation / isAdaptationOf</item>
                     <item>hasAlternate / isAlternateOf</item>
                     <item>hasArrangement / isArrangementOf</item>
                     <item>hasComplement / isComplementOf</item>
                     <item>hasEmbodiment / isEmbodimentOf</item>
                     <item>hasExemplar / isExemplarOf</item>
                     <item>hasImitation / isImitationOf</item>
                     <item>hasPart / isPartOf</item>
                     <item>hasRealization / isRealizationOf</item>
                     <item>hasReconfiguration / isReconfigurationOf</item>
                     <item>hasReproduction / isReproductionOf</item>
                     <item>hasRevision / isRevisionOf</item>
                     <item>hasSuccessor / isSuccessorOf</item>
                     <item>hasSummarization / isSummarizationOf</item>
                     <item>hasSupplement / isSupplementOf</item>
                     <item>hasTransformation / isTransformationOf</item>
                     <item>hasTranslation / isTranslationOf</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Some of these relationships are already implicitly expressed by the MEI structural model: FRBR defines an expression entity as a realization of a work, but as this relation is implied by the expressionList element’s child relationship to its parent work element, the hasRealization/isRealizationOf relation does not need to be explicitly declared. Likewise, it is not necessary to specify by means of relation elements that an item is an exemplar of the source described by its parent source element. This resembles the FRBR model, which allows 1:n relationships both between works and expressions, and between manifestations and items.</p>
                  <p>However, as FRBR allows n:n relations between expressions and manifestations (in MEI: sources), a hierarchical model based on the structure of XML is clearly insufficient to express all possible expression / manifestation combinations. It is therefore required to declare these relations explicitly. In FRBR terms, a manifestation / source is an embodiment of an expression.</p>

                  <p>Within the <gi scheme="MEI">componentList</gi> element, the order of child elements implicitly describes a hasSuccessor/isSuccessorOf relationship between components, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, it defines a certain sequence such as the movements of a work. In other cases, <gi scheme="MEI">relation</gi> elements may be needed to explicitly encode relationships not otherwise defined by encoding order or hierarchy. For instance, the hasReproduction/isReproductionOf relationship may be used to indicate that one source is a reprint of another.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, the use of <gi scheme="MEI">componentList</gi> implicitly defines a hasPart/isPartOf relationship between the componentList element’s parent and its child elements. Using the <gi scheme="MEI">relationList</gi> and relation elements to define their relationship, the four component works in the "Der Ring des Nibelungen" example above could alternatively be encoded as sibling work elements to the "Ring" work element.</p>

                  <head>RelatedItem vs. FRBR</head>
                  <p>MEI offers two related concepts for capturing relations between bibliographic items. The model of <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>, as described in chapter <ptr target="#sharedRelatedItemDesc"/> of these Guidelines, is derived from MODS v3.4 (see documentation <ref target="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-userguide-elements.html#relateditem">here</ref>). Its purpose in MEI is to encode bibliographic references between mostly "secondary" material, like reviews, articles, and so on. It may be used to provide cross-references between information encoded in different places of the header.</p>
                  <p>However, <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> is less ideal for describing the relations between works, differing versions of these works, the sources in which those versions are transmitted, and where applicable the individual copies of a print. For these situations, it is strongly recommended to use the <ptr target="#FRBR"/> instead. This module is based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, as <ref target="http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records">specified</ref> by the <ref target="http://www.ifla.org">IFLA</ref>. It allows a much finer description of relationships between such "primary" entities. For compatibility reasons, both models should not be confused or mixed under any circumstances.</p>

                  <p>The first few notes and/or words of a piece of music are often used for identification purposes, especially when the piece has only a generic title, such as "Sonata no. 3". They appear in catalogs of music and in tables of contents of printed music that include multiple works.</p>
                  <p>The following elements are provided for the inclusion of incipits:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The elements <gi scheme="MEI">incipCode</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">incipText</gi> are available for the inclusion of coded incipits of music notation and textual incipits, respectively. The <gi scheme="MEI">incipText</gi> element should contain only the initial performed text of the work, while <gi scheme="MEI">incipCode</gi> may contain both words and music, depending on the capabilities of the scheme used to encode it. When both music and text are provided in <gi scheme="MEI">incipCode</gi>, it may be helpful to repeat the text in <gi scheme="MEI">incipText</gi> in order to provide easier access to only the text, for example, for indexing of the text without having to extract it from the coded incipit.</p>
                  <p>Both <gi scheme="MEI">incipCode</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">incipText</gi> allow reference to an external file location via the <att>target</att> attribute and specification of the internet media type of the external file via the <att>mimetype</att> attribute.</p>
                  <p>An MEI-encoded incipit may be captured in a <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> sub-element.</p>
                  <p>In addition, <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> may be used as a sub-element of <gi scheme="MEI">incip</gi> to include an image of an incipit.</p>
                  <p>To facilitate the capture of metadata associated with an incipit, MEI allows the following sub-elements within <gi scheme="MEI">incip</gi>. The order of their presentation below follows the order in which they must appear in this context.</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="tempo"/>
                        <specDesc key="role"/>
                        <specDesc key="clef"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Usually, the metadata captured in this manner is rendered alongside or in lieu of a coded or graphical incipit. It may or may not serve in a work identification capacity, depending on whether the incipit is intended to represent the entire work or a segment of the work. For example, if an incipit is provided for each aria in an opera, then the metadata pertains only to the aria, not the entire work.</p>

               <div xml:id="headerWorkKeyTempoMeter" type="div3">
                  <head>Key, Tempo, and Meter</head>
                  <p>The attributes key, tempo, and meter are often helpful for identifying a musical work when it does not have a distinctive title.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">key</gi> element is used exclusively within bibliographic descriptions. Do not confuse this element with <gi scheme="MEI">keySig</gi>, which is used within the body of an MEI file to record this data for musical notation. Likewise, <gi scheme="MEI">meter</gi> should not be confused with the attributes used by staffDef and scoreDef to record meter-related data for notated music. The <gi scheme="MEI">tempo</gi> element can be used here as well as in the body of an MEI document; however, its attributes other than <att>xml:id</att>, <att>label</att>, <att>n</att>, <att>base</att>, and <att>lang</att> are meaningless in the MEI header context, and therefore should be avoided within a work description. The <gi scheme="MEI">mensuration</gi> element is available for the description of works in the mensural repertoire. When a work uses meter and mensural signs, both <gi scheme="MEI">mensuration</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">meter</gi> elements may be used.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">creation</gi> element is intended to contain a brief, machine-processable statement of the circumstances of the work’s creation. Its content is limited to text and the <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">geogName</gi> elements.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">history</gi> element is a container for additional non-bibliographic details relating to a work. It may use the <gi scheme="MEI">eventList</gi> element to provide a list of key events in the creation and performance history of the work. The <gi scheme="MEI">eventList</gi> element is comprised of <gi scheme="MEI">event</gi> elements containing a brief description of the associated event, including dates and locations where the event took place. An event list may use the <att>type</att> attribute to distinguish between multiple event lists with different functions, such as a list of events in the compositional process and a list of performance dates.</p>
                  <p>Event lists and other text components, such as paragraphs, tables, lists, and text divisions (<gi scheme="MEI">div</gi>) may be interleaved when an 'essay-like' work history is desired.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">event</gi> element permits either a text-centric or a data-centric model. The text-centric model is provided for prose descriptions, while the data-centric model accommodates event descriptions that consist of a collection of descriptive phrases. In the text-centric model, paragraphs, tables, and lists may be used. In the data-centric model, however, only certain phrase-level elements, may appear.</p>

                  <head>Language Usage</head>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">langUsage</gi> element is used within the <gi scheme="MEI">workList</gi> element to describe the languages, sublanguages, dialects, etc. represented within a work. It contains one or more <gi scheme="MEI">language</gi> elements, each of which provides information about a single language.</p>

                  <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">language</gi> element may be supplied for each different language used in a document. If used, its <att>xml:id</att> attribute should specify an appropriate language identifier. This is particularly important if extended language identifiers have been used as the value of <att>xml:lang</att> attributes elsewhere in the document.</p>
                  <p>Here is an example of the use of this element:</p>

                  <p>The following elements are available for description of a composition’s performing forces:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">perfMedium</gi> element provides the possibility of describing a work in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required. In the case of a dramatic work, the dramatis personae and associated voice qualities may be enumerated using <gi scheme="MEI">castList</gi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">perfResList</gi> element describes the necessary instrumental and vocal resources.</p>
                  <div xml:id="headerWorkCast" type="div4">
                     <head>Cast Lists</head>
                     <p>A cast list is a specialized form of list, conventionally found at the start or end of a dramatic work, usually listing all the speaking/singing and non-speaking/singing roles in the play, often with additional description (‘Cataplasma, a maker of Periwigges and Attires’) or the name of an actor or actress (‘Old Lady Squeamish. Mrs Rutter’).</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Cast lists often function as identifying metadata and for this reason are permitted within the description of a work.</p>
                     <p>Because the format and internal structure of cast lists are unpredictable, a <gi scheme="MEI">castList</gi> may contain any combination of <gi scheme="MEI">castItem</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">castGrp</gi> elements.</p>
                     <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">castItem</gi> element may contain any mixture of text and the following elements:</p>

                        <specList>

                     <p>In the following example, <gi scheme="MEI">role</gi> provides the name of the dramatic character and <gi scheme="MEI">roleDesc</gi> contains a brief description of the role. The <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi> element is used to describe the voice range of the role.</p>

                     <p>However, this element is unlikely to be useful in the context of a work description. It may be used here, however, for the very rare occasion when a work was conceived for and is only performable by a single person or group, as for certain "performance art" works.</p>
                     <p>It is common to find some roles presented in groups or sublists. Roles are also often grouped together by their function. To accommodate these situations, the <gi scheme="MEI">castGrp</gi> element is provided as a component of <gi scheme="MEI">castList</gi>. It may contain any combination of <gi scheme="MEI">castItem</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">castGrp</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">roleDesc</gi> elements.</p>

                     <p>The preceding example also demonstrates how instrumental doublings can be accommodate through the use of nested <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi> elements.

                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi> element provides the <att>codedval</att> attribute, which can be used to record a coded value that represents the string value stored as the element’s content. It is recommended that coded values be taken from a standardized list, such as the <ref target="http://www.urfm.braidense.it/risorse/searchmedium_en.php">International Association of Music Libraries' Medium of Performance Codes List</ref> or the <ref target="http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/marcmusperf.html">MARC Instruments and Voices Code List</ref>.</p>

In some schemes, the order of items in the list is significant, for example, from major topic to minor; in others, the list has an organized substructure of its own.

                  <p>Detailed analysis of the title page and other preliminaries of older printed books and manuscripts is of major importance in descriptive bibliography and the cataloging of printed books.

                  <p>The physical rendition of title page information is often of considerable importance. One approach to this requirement would be to use the <gi scheme="MEI">rend</gi> element, described in chapter <ptr target="#sharedTextRendition"/> to specify the rendition of each of the components of the title page. Another would be to employ a CSS stylesheet. Finally, a module customized for the description of typographic entities such as pages, lines, rules, etc., bearing special-purpose attributes to describe line-height, leading, degree of kerning, font, etc. could be employed.</p>

                  <p>While many other elements within <gi scheme="MEI">physDesc</gi> describe specific features of manuscripts and prints in prose, <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> is intended to be processable.

                  <p>The nesting of <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> elements reflects the nesting of paper sheets that make up the text block of the source. For instance, if a manuscript consists of two folded sheets of paper, with a single, unfolded sheet in the middle, this would be encoded with two nested <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> elements, where the inner one has an additional <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> element:</p>

                     <p>Within <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi>, each <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> element may specify its dimensions using the following attributes:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The values of those attributes, however, specify the height and width of the digital resource, the scan of the source, and they are typically given in pixels (see <ptr target="#facsimileElements"/>). In contrast, <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> are supposed to provide the dimensions of the original source in cm or inches. This makes it possible to combine separate parts of a manuscripts stored in different libraries, which are scanned at different resolutions. In case of <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> elements, these dimensions apply to the <hi rend="italic">folded</hi> sheet.</p>
                     <p>Some printed scholarly editions like the <hi rend="italic">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</hi> provide very detailed information about the sizes and binding of individual leaves of a manuscript; with <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> and its children it is possible to encode that information in processable ways, even without providing digitizations of the sources via <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi>.</p>

                     <p>The exact position of the patch on the underlying surface may be specified using the optional <att>x</att> and <att>y</att> attributes, which are used to specify the distance from the upper left corner of the patch from the upper left corner of the surface it is attached to. At this point, it is not possible to specify rotation.</p>
                     <p>The (optional) <att>attached.by</att> attribute specifies by which means the patch is attached. Suggested values are: <val>glue</val> (patch is glued on surface beneath), <val>thread</val> (patch is sewn on surface beneath), <val>needle</val> (patch is pinned to the surface beneath), <val>tape</val> (patch is taped on surface beneath using an adhesive strip) and <val>staple</val> (patch is attached on surface beneath using a staple), but other values may be used as necessary.</p>
                     <p>While the <gi scheme="MEI">patch</gi> element provides information about the attachment of a patch, the actual patch is encoded as a <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> child of <gi scheme="MEI">patch</gi>.</p>

In this case, the bounding box dimensions are given, together with <att>x</att> and <att>y</att> to indicate the upper left point on the original page. If, however, the removed section is available by itself, then a corresponding <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> (or <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi>) should be placed inside the cutout element, and should provide it’s own dimensions using <att>width</att> and <att>height</att> there.

               <p>This chapter introduces common use cases for MEI metadata.</p>

                  <head>Independent Headers</head>
                  <p>Many libraries, repositories, research sites and related institutions collect bibliographic and documentary information about machine readable music documents without necessarily collecting the music documents themselves. Such institutions may thus want access to the header of an MEI document without its attached text in order to build catalogs, indexes and databases that can be used to locate relevant texts at remote locations, obtain full documentation about those texts, and learn how to obtain them. This section describes a set of practices by which the metadata headers of MEI documents can be encoded separately from those documents and exchanged as freestanding MEI documents. Headers exchanged independently of the documents they describe are called independent headers.</p>
                  <div xml:id="headerIndependentHeaderDefinition" type="div4">
                     <head>Independent MEI Headers</head>
                     <p>An independent header is an MEI metadata header that can be exchanged as an independent document between libraries, archives, collections, projects, and individuals.</p>
                     <p>The structure of an independent header is exactly the same as that of an header attached to a document. This means that an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> can be extracted from an MEI document and sent to a receiving institution with little or no change.</p>
                     <p>When deciding which information to include in the independent header, and the format or structure of that information, the following should be kept in mind:</p>
                     <list rend="bulleted">
                        <item>The independent header should provide full bibliographic information about the encoded text, its sources, where the text can be located, and any restrictions governing its use.</item>
                        <item>The independent header should contain useful information about the encoding of the text itself. In this regard, it is highly recommended that the encoding description be as complete as possible. The Guidelines do not require that the encoding description be included in the header (since some simple transcriptions of small items may not require it), but in practice the use of a header without an encoding description would be severely limited.</item>
                        <item>The independent header should be amenable to automatic processing, particularly for loading into databases and for the creation of publications, indexes, and finding aids, without undue editorial intervention on the part of the receiving institution. For this reason, two recommendations are made regarding the format or structure of the header: first, where there is a choice between a prose content model and one that contains a formal series of specialized elements, wherever possible and appropriate the specialized elements should be preferred to unstructured prose. Second, with respect to corpora, information about each of the texts within a corpus should be included in the overall corpus-level <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>. That is, source information, editorial practices, encoding descriptions, and the like should be included in the relevant sections of the corpus <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>, with pointers to them from the headers of the individual texts included in the corpus. There are three reasons for this recommendation: first, the corpus-level header will contain the full array of bibliographic and documentary information for each of the texts in a corpus, and thus be of great benefit to remote users, who may have access only to the independent header; second, such a layout is easier for the coder to maintain than searching for information throughout a text; and third, generally speaking, this practice results in greater overall consistency, especially with respect to bibliographic citations.</item>

                  <p>The following element is provided to accommodate non-MEI metadata:</p>

                  <p>An MEI processor is not required to validate or otherwise process any markup within the <gi scheme="MEI">extMeta</gi> element.

               <div xml:id="headerMinimalRecommendedHeader" type="div3">
                  <head>Minimal and Recommended Header Information</head>
                  <p>The MEI header allows for the provision of a very large amount of information concerning the text itself, its source, its encodings, and revisions of it, as well as a wealth of descriptive information, such as the languages it uses and the situation(s) in which it was produced, together with the setting and identity of participants within it. This diversity and richness reflects the diversity of uses to which it is envisaged that electronic texts conforming to these Guidelines will be put. It is emphatically not intended that all of the elements described above should be present in every MEI Header.</p>
                  <p>The amount of encoding in a header will depend both on the nature and the intended use of the text. At one extreme, an encoder may expect that the header will be needed only to provide a bibliographic identification of the text adequate to local needs. At the other, wishing to ensure that their texts can be used for the widest range of applications, encoders will want to document as explicitly as possible both bibliographic and descriptive information, in such a way that no prior or ancillary knowledge about the text is needed in order to process it. The header in such a case will be very full, approximating the kind of documentation often supplied in the form of a manual. Most texts will lie somewhere between these extremes; textual corpora in particular will tend more to the latter extreme. In the remainder of this section we demonstrate first the minimal, and then a commonly recommended, level of encoding for the bibliographic information held by the MEI header.</p>
                  <p>Supplying only the level of encoding required, the MEI header of a single text will look like the following example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/header/header-sample078.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>The only mandatory component of the MEI Header is the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element. Within this element, <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi> are required constituents. Within the title statement, a title is required. Within the <gi scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi>, a publisher, distributor, or other agency responsible for the file is required.</p>
                  <p>While not formally required, additional information is recommended for a minimally effective header. For example, it is recommended that the person or corporate entity responsible for the creation of the encoding should be specified using <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> within the <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> element. It is also recommended that information about the source, or sources, of the encoding be included. Each <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> element should contain at the least a loosely structured bibliographic citation that identifies the source used to construct the MEI file.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, If the electronic transcription is a member of a series of publications, the series title and publisher should be included using the <gi scheme="MEI">seriesStmt</gi> element. It is also common for cataloging records to include genre and/or form information, here represented by the MEI <gi scheme="MEI">classification</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>We now present the same example header, expanded to include additionally recommended information, adequate for most bibliographic purposes, in particular to allow for the creation of an AACR2-conformant bibliographic record.</p>

                  <p>Mapping elements from the MEI metadata header to another descriptive system may help a repository harvest selected data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. For this purpose, the following attribute is provided on most elements occurring within <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>:</p>

                  <p>The encoding system to which fields are mapped must be specified in <att>analog</att>. When possible, subfields as well as fields should be specified, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, subfields within MARC fields.</p>
               </div>
               <div xml:id="corpus" type="div3">
                  <head>Musical Corpora</head>
                  <p>The term corpus may refer to any collection of musical data, although it is often reserved for collections which have been organized or collected with a particular end in view, generally to illustrate a particular characteristic of, or to demonstrate the variety found in, a group of related texts. The principal distinguishing characteristic of a corpus is that its components have been selected or structured according to some conscious set of design criteria.</p>
                  <p>In MEI, a corpus is regarded as a composite text because, although each discrete document in a corpus clearly has a claim to be considered as a text in its own right, it is also regarded as a subdivision of some larger object, if only for convenience of analysis. In corpora, the component samples are clearly distinct texts, but the systematic collection, standardized preparation, and common markup of the corpus often make it useful to treat the entire corpus as a unit, too. Corpora share a number of characteristics with other types of composite texts, including anthologies and collections. Most notably, different components of composite texts may exhibit different structural properties, thus potentially requiring elements from different MEI modules.</p>
                  <p>Aside from these high-level structural differences, and possibly differences of scale, the encoding of language corpora and the encoding of individual texts present identical sets of problems. Therefore, any of the encoding techniques and elements presented in other chapters of these Guidelines may therefore prove relevant to some aspect of corpus encoding and may be used in corpora.</p>
                  <div xml:id="corpusModuleOverview" type="div4">
                     <head>Corpus Module Overview</head>
                     <p>The meiCorpus module defines a single element:</p>
                     <p>
                        <specList>
                           <specDesc key="meiCorpus"/>
                        </specList>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">meiCorpus</gi> element is intended for the encoding of corpora, though it may also be useful in encoding any collection of disparate materials. The individual samples in the corpus are encoded as separate <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> elements, and the entire corpus is enclosed in an <gi scheme="MEI">meiCorpus</gi> element. Each sample has the usual structure for a <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> document, comprising an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> followed by a <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi> element. The corpus, too, has a corpus-level <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element, in which the corpus as a whole, and encoding practices common to multiple samples may be described. The overall structure of an MEI-conformant corpus is thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/corpus/corpus-sample210.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>This two-level structure allows for metadata to be specified at the corpus level, at the individual text level, or at both. However, metadata which relates to the whole corpus rather than to its individual components should be removed from the individual component metadata and included only in the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element prefixed to the whole.</p>
                     <p>In some cases, the design of a corpus is reflected in its internal structure. For example, a corpus of musical incipits might be arranged to combine all compositions of one type (symphonies, songs, chamber music, etc.) into some higher-level grouping, possibly with sub-groups for date of publication, instrumentation, key, etc. The <gi scheme="MEI">meiCorpus</gi> element provides no support for reflecting such internal structure in the markup: it treats the corpus as an undifferentiated series of components, each tagged with an <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> element.</p>
                     <p>If it is essential to reflect the organization of a corpus into sub-components, then the members of the corpus should be encoded as composite texts instead, using the <gi scheme="MEI">group</gi> element described section <ptr target="#sharedMusicElement"/>. The mechanisms for corpus characterization described in this chapter, however, are designed to reduce the need to do this. Useful groupings of components may easily be expressed using the classification and identification elements described in section <ptr target="#headerWorkClass"/>, and those for associating declarations with corpus components described in section <ptr target="#headerAssociatingMetadataAndData"/>. These mechanisms also allow several different methods of text grouping to co-exist, each to be used as needed at different times. This helps minimize the danger of cross-classification and mis-classification of samples, and helps improve the flexibility with which parts of a corpus may be characterized for different applications.</p>
                     <p>All composite texts share the characteristic that their different component texts may be of structurally similar or dissimilar types. If all component texts may all be encoded using the same module, then no problem arises. If however they require different modules, then the various modules must all be included in the schema.</p>

                     <head>Combining Corpus and Text Headers</head>
                     <p>An MEI-conformant document may have more than one header only in the case of a TEI corpus, which must have a header in its own right, as well as the obligatory header for each text. Every element specified in a corpus-header is understood as if it appeared within every text header in the corpus. An element specified in a text header but not in the corpus header supplements the specification for that text alone. If any element is specified in both corpus and text headers, the corpus header element is over-ridden for that text alone.</p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> for a corpus text is understood to be prefixed by the <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> given in the corpus header. All other optional elements of the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> should be omitted from an individual corpus text header unless they differ from those specified in the corpus header. All other header elements behave identically, in the manner documented in chapter <ptr target="#headerstructure"/>. This makes it possible to state information which is common to the whole of the corpus in the corpus header, while still allowing for individual texts to vary from this common metadata.</p>
                     <p>For example, the following markup shows the structure of a corpus consisting of three texts, the first and last of which share the same encoding description. The second one has its own encoding description.</p>

                     <p>These Guidelines include proposals for the identification and encoding of a far greater variety of textual features and characteristics than is likely to be either feasible or desirable in any one corpus, however large and ambitious. For most large-scale corpus projects, it will therefore be necessary to determine a subset of recommended elements appropriate to the anticipated needs of the project; these mechanisms include the ability to exclude selected element types, add new element types, and change the names of existing elements.</p>
                     <p>Because of the high cost of identifying and encoding many textual features, and the difficulty in ensuring consistent practice across very large corpora, encoders may find it convenient to divide the set of elements to be encoded into the following four categories:</p>

                        <label>required</label>
                        <item>texts included within the corpus will always encode textual features in this category, should they exist in the text</item>
                        <label>recommended</label>
                        <item>textual features in this category will be encoded wherever economically and practically feasible; where present but not encoded, a note in the header should be made.</item>
                        <label>optional</label>
                        <item>textual features in this category may or may not be encoded; no conclusion about the absence of such features can be inferred from the absence of the corresponding element in a given text.</item>
                        <label>proscribed</label>
                        <item>textual features in this category are deliberately not encoded; they may be transcribed as unmarked up text, or represented as gap elements, or silently omitted, as appropriate.</item>
