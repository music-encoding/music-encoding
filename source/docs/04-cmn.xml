            <head>Repertoire: Common Music Notation</head>
            <p>The module described in this chapter offers the means to describe music in so-called ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN, sometimes referred to as ‘Common Western Music Notation’). For this purpose, it provides a number of special elements and adds several attribute classes to elements from the <ptr target="#shared"/> module.</p>
            <div xml:id="cmnintro" type="div2">
               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p>This chapter is supposed to frame the repertoire target by the module, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, what is Common Music Notation?</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="cmnBasics" type="div2">
               <head>Basic Elements of CMN</head>
               <p>This section describes the use of basic features of MEI important for encoding CMN material. Most of the elements discussed here are defined in chapter <ptr target="#shared"/> of these Guidelines, but are used in music from the CMN repertoire in specialized ways.</p>
               <div xml:id="cmnMeasures" type="div3">
                  <head>The Role of the Measure Element</head>
                  <p>Arguably, the most important element of the CMN module is the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> element. It is used as a structural unit inside <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements and acts as a container for ‘events’ from the <ident type="class">model.eventLike</ident> class, such as notes, chords and rests as well as ‘control events’ from the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class, such as slurs and indications of dynamics.</p>
                  <p>The following example demonstrates the use of the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> element:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> slices the flow of a score or part into chunks that normally comply with a duration determined by the meter defined within a preceding <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element. Each staff in the source material is represented by a <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> element. As the order of the staff elements in the file does not have to reflect their order in the original document, to eliminate confusion they should always refer to a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element, using either an <att>n</att> or <att>def</att> attribute. Whereas the <att>def</att> attribute uses the xs:anyURI datatype, the <att>n</att> value refers to the closest preceding <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi> with the same value in its <att>n</att> attribute.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Each <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> may hold a number of <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements to reflect multiple ‘voices’. Just as with <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi>, the order of the <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements in the file does not have to reflect their original order in the document, so they also possess <att>n</att> and <att>def</att> attributes for association with the appropriate layer definition.</p>

                  <head>Defining Score Parameters for CMN</head>
                  <p>When encoding a score in CMN, MEI relies on the following elements from the <ptr target="#shared"/> module:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="scoreDef"/>
                        <specDesc key="staffGrp"/>
                        <specDesc key="staffDef"/>
                        <specDesc key="layerDef"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> element is used to specify the common parameters of a score, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, key and meter. The most important attributes for this purpose are:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="att.meterSigDefault.log" atts="meter.count meter.unit"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.meterSigDefault.log" atts="meter.sym"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.keySigDefault.log" atts="keysig"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following example describes a score in common time with 3 flats:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmn/cmn-sample095.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>For encoding more complex time signatures, simple mathematical symbols such as asterisks and plus signs are allowed in <att>meter.count</att>.</p>
                  <p>Non-standard key signatures have to be encoded with a <gi scheme="MEI">keySig</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>Other attributes allow the description of default page and system margins and fonts for text and music:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="att.pages"
                                  atts="page.width page.height page.leftmar page.topmar page.rightmar page.botmar"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.systems" atts="system.leftmar system.topmar system.rightmar"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.textStyle" atts="text.name text.fam text.size"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.notationStyle" atts="music.name music.size"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.lyricStyle" atts="lyric.name lyric.fam lyric.size"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other attributes that allow the specification of many further details of a score. These are available from the element definitions accessible at <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi>.</p>
                  <p>When content is provided for <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, it must contain a <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> element. This element is used to gather individual staves and other staff groups. This is useful for collecting instrumental or vocal groups in a large score, such as woodwinds, brasses, etc., and for assigning a shared label to the group, using the <gi scheme="MEI">label</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">labelAbbr</gi> subelements. The <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> element is also used for the two staves of a grand staff. The <att>bar.thru</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> allows one to specify whether bar lines are drawn across the space between staves of that group or only on the staves themselves.</p>
                  <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element is used to describe an individual staff of a <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> or performer <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi>. It bears most of the attributes described above. The <gi scheme="MEI">label</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">labelAbbr</gi> subelements may be used for providing staff labels for the first and subsequent systems.</p>
                  <p>Every <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> must have an <att>n</att> attribute with an integer as its value. The first occurrence of a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> with a given number must also indicate the number of staff lines via the <att>lines</att> attribute.</p>
                  <p>The order of <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> elements within <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> follows the order of staves in the source document or planned rendering. The individual <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> elements within a <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> refer to these <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> declarations using their own <att>n</att> attribute values. Therefore, the encoding order of staves within a measure does not have to mimic the order of the <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> elements with <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the parameters inherited from <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, the following attributes are important for <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> elements:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="att.cleffing.log"
                                  atts="clef.line clef.shape clef.dis clef.dis.place"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>A staff with a tenor clef is encoded as in the following example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmn/cmn-sample096.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the case of transposing instruments, the key-related attributes described above may be used to override the written key expressed in the <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> element. As a basic principle, MEI always captures written pitches, so the <att>trans.diat</att> and <att>trans.semi</att> attributes may be used to indicate the number of diatonic steps and semitones to calculate sounded pitch from written pitch. The piccolo and E♭ clarinet staves in the example below utilize these attributes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are a number of additional elements that can be used as children of <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> in order to describe additional features of the staff, such as the color of a clef or a key signature added in a different hand. These elements include:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="clef"/>

                  <p>With the exception of <gi scheme="MEI">label</gi>, these elements may also occur within the flow of musical events captured in a <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>, since they are members of <ident type="class">model.eventLike</ident>. In the layer context they function as milestones and affect all following content assigned to the layer (even in subsequent measures) until their information is again overridden either by the same element bearing different information or a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>. In this context, it is also possible to combine them with the elements described in chapters <ptr target="#critApp"/> and <ptr target="#editTrans"/> of these Guidelines.</p>
                  <p>Such flexibility as this may require close inspection of an encoding to retrieve the correct definitions for a given staff. As a general rule, the closest preceding and most specific element provides this information: For example, a <gi scheme="MEI">keySig</gi> in the preceding measure is more relevant than a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> at the beginning of the section, which is more relevant than a <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> at the beginning of the score. However, a section-specific <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> that provides only information about the meter does not override the more specific information about key signature gathered from a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> for a transposing instrument.</p>
                  <p>Every <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> may contain a number of <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi> elements, which may be used to establish default values for the distinct layers sharing one staff. MEI does not use the term ‘voice’ to describe these ‘musical threads’ because that term implies continuity across measure boundaries. Given the sometimes arbitrary relationships between these threads from measure to measure as well as across staves, MEI uses the more neutral term ‘layer’.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes it is necessary to re-define the parameters of a score or a staff. For example, a score may change keys, the number of staves, or use different layout settings. Likewise, a staff may change its clef, change the number of layers, or become invisible. To accommodate these changes, <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> is allowed to occur in the following locations:</p>

                  <p>It is also possible to include <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> in staves and layers when the MEI All schema is in use; however, this practice is not recommended for the CMN repertoire.</p>
                  <p>The following example shows how to change the key and meter signatures within a score. The <att>keysig.cancelaccid</att> attribute may be used to control the position of the cancellation accidentals of the key signature change, while the <att>keysig.visible</att> can be used to hide the key signature entirely.</p>

                        <p>The default values for <att>pname</att> and <att>oct</att> conform to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation">Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN)</ref> (also known as American Standard Pitch Notation); that is, the letters A–G indicate the musical note name of a pitch, and the numbers 0–9 indicate the octave range to which a note belongs. <att>pname</att> values differ from this convention only by using lower case values for pitches (a–g instead of A-G). The value for <att>oct</att> changes between B and C, that is, octave ranges go from C, D, …, G, A, to B. For example, <hi rend="italic">middle C</hi> or <hi rend="italic">c'</hi> (the C in the middle, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, fourth C key from left, on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is represented on the first ledger line in G clef notation and labelled as <hi rend="italic">C4</hi>, in the naming convention of SPN. The note one semitone below would be labelled <hi rend="italic">B3</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">A4</hi> would refer to the first A above <hi rend="italic">C4</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The usual CMN-specific values for <att>dur</att> are:</p>

                        <p>Additionally, the following two values borrowed from mensural notation are allowed, as they sometimes also appear in CMN:</p>

                        <p>Dotted durational values are accommodated by the <att>dots</att> attribute, which records the number of written augmentation dots. Thus, a dotted quarter note is represented as in the following example:</p>

                        <p>The CMN module adds two optional attributes, <att>grace</att> and <att>grace.time</att>, to <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi>. The presence of the <att>grace</att> attribute indicates a grace note or chord.</p>

                        <p>Grace notes are not counted when determining the measure’s conformance to the current time signature. Therefore, the <att>dur</att> attribute records only the <hi rend="italic">written</hi> rhythmic value of the grace note. The time necessary for the performance of grace notes can be unspecified, calculated based on taking time from other non-grace notes, or specified precisely using the <att>dur.ges</att> attribute.</p>
                        <p>The values of <att>grace</att> indicate from which note time is ‘borrowed’ to perform the grace note: The preceding note, in which case the value <val>unacc</val> (unaccented) is used, or the following note, when the value <val>acc</val> (accented) is appropriate. Technically, this value determines if the note following the grace will keep its original onset time or will be slightly delayed to allow the grace note itself to be accented. Sometimes it is not clear how to perform a grace; in these situations the value <val>unknown</val> allows one to indicate a grace note while unambiguously stating that its performed duration remains unknown.</p>
                        <p>The <att>grace.time</att> attribute is only to be used in combination with the <att>grace</att> attribute. It records the amount of time (as a percentage of the written duration) that the grace note should ‘steal’ from the preceding note (when <att>grace</att>="unacc") or the following note (when <att>grace</att>="acc").</p>
                        <p>Grace notes can be placed within a <gi scheme="MEI">graceGrp</gi> element, which itself allows all values for <att>grace</att> as explained above. The optional <att>attach</att> attribute is used to record whether the grace note group is attached to the following event or to the preceding one. The <gi scheme="MEI">graceGrp</gi> element can be used with single or multiple grace notes.</p>
                        <p>More information about grace notes in the context of other CMN ornaments is available in chapter <ptr target="#cmnOrnaments"/>.</p>

                        <p>A chord is any set of pitches consisting of multiple notes that are to be played simultaneously and are usually grouped together visually with a single stem. In MEI the <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi> element functions as a container for all participating notes. Also it features many attributes that are allowed for notes, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, usually all notes in a chord have a common duration, so it can be applied to the whole chord within it’s <att>dur</att> attribute.</p>
                        <p>Some notational features like articulations or lyrics are connected to a whole chord instead of a single note. Therefore elements like <gi scheme="MEI">artic</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">verse</gi> are also allowed as children of <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi> elements.

                        <p>Alternatively, the encoder may choose to treat the notes in the lower staff as logically belonging to the top staff and to ‘displace’ them using the <att>staff</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>. Some use cases, however, may require filling the time that those notes would normally occupy using the <gi scheme="MEI">space</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#sharedNoteSpacing"/>. Using this mechanism, the example above could also be encoded like so:</p>

                        <p>The choice between these two methods of representing material that crosses staves is often software-dependent.</p>
                        <p>Whereas <att>stem.with</att> can be used to define stems that connect notes across different staves (cross-staff chords) <att>stem.sameas</att> is meant for describing a stem that connects two notes pertaining to different layers within the same staff.</p>
                        <p>The typical scenario for <att>stem.sameas</att> is orchestral scores where two wind instruments are notated on one single staff. Normally, the notes have individual stems pointing in opposite directions. However, it is common engraving practice that notes of the same duration are often stemmed together between the parts encoded in separate layers. The following example demonstrates this practice in the wind instruments (bassoons and trumpets in meas. 1 - 3, horns in meas. 3)</p>

                  <head>Timestamps and Durations</head>
                  <p>MEI offers multiple ways of defining onsets and offsets of timed musical events such as notes and slurs. The most common and most musician-friendly approach to this is through the use of a combination of the attributes <att>tstamp</att> and <att>dur</att>, which are made available by the attribute classes <ident type="class">att.timestamp.log</ident> (inherited by <ident type="class">att.controlEvent</ident>) and <ident type="class">att.timestamp2.log</ident>, both from the shared module.</p>
                  <p>The timestamp (<att>tstamp</att>) of a musical event is calculated in relation to the meter of the current measure and resembles the so-called ‘beat’ position. In a common time measure with four quarter notes, the timestamp of each quarter equals its beat position in the measure: The first quarter has a timestamp of 1, the second has a timestamp of 2, and so on. MEI defines the value of <att>tstamp</att> as a real number; the second eighth note position in a measure would thus be represented by the value of "1.5". The range of possible values is defined as starting with zero and ending with the number of metrical units in a measure (the ‘numerator’ in a time signature) + 1. This allows the capture of all graphical positions starting from the left bar line ('0') and ending with the right bar line of the measure ('5', in the case of 4/4 time).</p>
                  <p>For expressing durations, MEI offers the <att>dur</att> attribute. This attribute is described in section <ptr target="#cmnNotesBasic"/>.</p>
                  <p>For ‘spanning’ elements like slurs, which are members of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class, it is often more intuitive to record two timestamps – one for the onset of the event and one for its termination. Because the termination of the event may be in a succeeding measure, the second timestamp (<att>tstamp2</att>) has a slightly different datatype than the one marking the initiation of the event. Its datatype is constrained to values following the formula "<hi rend="italic">xm + y</hi>", where <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is the number of full measures that this particular feature lasts (or the number of bar lines crossed) and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is the timestamp in the target measure where the feature ends. The timestamp is expressed using the same logic as described above. For example, a value of "0m+3" in 4/4 time indicates that the element bearing this attribute, a slur for example, ends on beat 3 of the same measure where it started. A value of "1m+1.5" would indicate an end on the second eighth note of the following measure. In 6/8 time, the value "2m+3" means that the feature ends two measures later on the third eighth note.</p>

                  <p>Use of the <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> element is straightforward. The beamed notes, rests, or chords are simply enclosed by the <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> element:</p>

                  <p>From the 19th century onwards, it became quite common to break secondary beams to increase readability of longer beamed passages. The optional <att>breaksec</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>s and <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi>s under the beam may be used to encode the breaking of secondary beams <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the note or chord bearing the attribute. The value of <att>breaksec</att> indicates the number of continuous beams. For example:</p>

                  <p>The encoding of such a beam is accomplished using the <att>form</att> attribute of the beam, which allows the following values:</p>

                  <p>The duration of notes, rests, or chords under a beam which carries the <att>form</att> attribute with a value of ‘acc’, ‘rit’, or ‘mixed’ must be treated specially. The first and last contained elements must specify a duration which matches the number of beams displayed at the point of these events. In the case of a ‘mixed’ beam, each event at the point of change in the number of secondary beams must carry a <att>dur</att> attribute. Beams like this may be encoded thusly:</p>

                  <p>Beams that connect events on different staves may be encoded in two different ways. First, a single-layer approach may be taken that treats the events lying under the beam as logically belonging to the same layer as the initial event but visually ‘displaced’ to an adjacent staff. In the following example from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Moszkowski">Moritz Moszkowski’s</ref>
                     <hi rend="italic">12 Pianoforte Studies for the left hand</hi>, Op. 92, MoszWV 117 this method makes even from a semantic perspective perfect sense. It can be achieved with an additional <att>staff</att> attribute value that contradicts the ‘normal’ staff placement indicated by the <att>n</att> attribute of their ancestor <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>In other contexts however, a staff-by-staff methodology may be employed in which the notes are encoded according to the staff on which they appear. This encoding style requires that each <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> element account for the total time encompassed by the beam; that is, each <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> must use one or more <gi scheme="MEI">space</gi> elements to account for the time occupied by notes on the opposing staff. For example, the time used by the first two notes of the beam must be represented on staff number 1 and the time taken by the last two notes of the beam must be filled on staff number 2.</p>

                  <p>Downstream processing needs are the determining factor in the choice between the two alternative encoding methods.</p>
                  <p>Due to the potential problem of overlapping hierarchies, the <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> element only allows the encoding of beams that do not cross bar lines. When beams cross bar lines, the use of the <gi scheme="MEI">beamSpan</gi> element is required. Unlike <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi>, the <gi scheme="MEI">beamSpan</gi> element does not contain the beamed notes as its children. Instead, it references the <att>xml:id</att> values of all affected notes in its <att>plist</att> attribute and denotes the initial and terminal notes of the beam using <att>startid</att> and <att>endid</att> attributes. This configuration allows beams to cross measure boundaries. The following example from <name ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schulhoff">Erwin Schulhoff’s</name>
                     <hi rend="italic">Violin Sonata</hi> demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing beams:</p>

                  <p>In addition to the explicit encoding of beams accommodated by the <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">beamSpan</gi> elements and the <att>beam</att> attribute, MEI allows for specification of default beaming behavior using the following attributes on <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi>:</p>
                  <list type="gloss">

                     <item>Provides an example of how automated beaming (including secondary beams) is to be performed.</item>
                     <label>beam.rests</label>
                     <item>Indicates whether automatically-drawn beams should include rests shorter than a quarter note duration.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <att>beam.group</att> attribute can be used to set a default beaming pattern to be used when no beaming is indicated at the layer level. It must contain a comma-separated list of time values that add up to a measure in the current meter, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, <val>4,4,4,4</val> in 4/4 time indicates that each quarter note worth of shorter notes should be beamed together. Parentheses can be used to indicate sub-groupings of secondary beams. For example, <val>(4.,4.,4.)</val> in 9/8 meter indicates one primary beam per measure with secondary beams broken at each dotted quarter duration, while <val>(4,4),(4,4)</val> in 4/4 will result in a measure of 16th notes being rendered with a primary beam covering all the notes and secondary beams for each group of four 16th notes.</p>
                  <p>The <att>beam.group</att> attribute is available on <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi> elements, making it possible to set different beaming patterns for each of these. Also, the beaming pattern can be changed anywhere score parameters may be changed, for example, at the start of sections. This beaming "directive" can be overridden by using <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">beamSpan</gi>, or <att>beam</att> attributes as described above. If none of these beaming specifications is used, then no beaming is implied. Default beaming can be explicitly ‘turned off’ by setting <att>beam.group</att> to an empty string.</p>

                  <p>One of the most specific features of CMN is the use of ‘curved lines’ which connect notes. These lines are used to indicate various musical features, depending on their context.</p>
                  <p>A tie is a curved line connecting <hi rend="italic">two</hi> notes of the <hi rend="italic">same pitch</hi>. The purpose of a tie is to join the durations of both notes, so that the first note sounds for the combined duration. In other words, there is only one onset for both notes.</p>
                  <p>In MEI, ties can be encoded in different ways, depending on the level of detail that the encoder wants to preserve. The simplest solution is to use the <att>tie</att> attribute found on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi>. <figure>

                  <p>A slur is a curved line that connects a group of notes of different pitch. It normally indicates that an instrument-specific performance technique should be applied to the affected notes. For example, in notation for winds, the notes should be played in one breath, while a single bow is indicated for string instruments.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In MEI, slurs may be encoded in a similar way to ties: <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi> bear a <att>slur</att> attribute that allows the commencement or ending of a slur at this element. The allowed values, however, are slightly different: The <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or <hi rend="italic">t</hi> are followed by a single digit in the range 1 to 6, as in the following example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmn/cmn-sample118.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason for this difference is that slurs, unlike ties, may overlap, so that a second slur may start while the first slur is still ongoing. The digit indicates the level of nesting of slurs on the note; ‘1’ indicates no nesting, while ‘2’ indicates the existence of 2 slurs in which this note participates, and so on. In the example below, the second and third quarter notes lie under 2 slurs. The second note is covered by the slur that begins on the preceding note and by the one that it starts. The third note is affected by the slur that begins on note one and by the one that starts on note two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>

                  </p>
                  <p>To support analytical operations, <att>slur</att> may take on more than one value. For example, the example above may be more explicitly encoded as:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this encoding, the notes in the beamed group are marked as participating in two slurs – one connecting just the beamed notes and one connecting the first and last notes of the layer. In ‘nested’ slurs like this, the function of the slurs is usually different. Here, the slur connecting the 8th notes indicates legato performance, while the longer slur functions as a phrase mark.</p>
                  <p>While ties are not normally allowed to cross layers or staves, slurs may. The following example demonstrates how cross-staff slurs may be encoded using the <att>slur</att> attribute:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmn/cmn-sample121.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Slurs and ties that cross system or page breaks are often split into two separate symbols for rendering. One slur or tie ends at the last bar line, another one starts at the beginning of the new system. MEI expects this to be the default rendering behavior, so that in situations like these, the regular <att>tie</att> or <att>slur</att> attributes are sufficient to describe both curved lines resulting from the split.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, however, one of these two symbols is missing in the document, or the encoder wants to provide additional (often visual) information about the slur or tie. In these cases, using an attribute is not an adequate solution. Therefore, MEI offers dedicated <gi scheme="MEI">tie</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi> elements. A third element, <gi scheme="MEI">phrase</gi>, is used to identify a unified melodic idea (in German: <hi rend="italic">Phrasierungsbogen</hi>), whereas the <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi> element is used as a generic element for all curved lines (in German: <hi rend="italic">Bogensetzung</hi>) except ties. All three elements have nearly identical models.</p>
                  <p>Another reason for using elements instead of attributes for ties, slurs, and phrase marks is that only elements may be combined with the functionality provided in chapters <ptr target="#editTrans"/> and <ptr target="#critApp"/> of these Guidelines.</p>
                  <p>Although these elements are allowed within a <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> to accommodate unmeasured notation, by convention in CMN they are normally placed inside <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, after the encoding of staves, alongside other so-called ‘control events’.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Obviously, to be complete the slur in the above example needs to be ‘attached’ to the notes somehow. The ‘vertical assignment’ can be indicated for the example above using the <att>staff</att> and <att>layer</att> attributes like so:</p>
                  <p>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ‘horizontal assignment’, the encoder may choose between two different mechanisms. The first uses two timestamp attributes as described in section <ptr target="#cmnTstamp"/>. The start and end points of the slur may be indicated thusly:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>By using <att>tstamp</att> and <att>tstamp2</att> attributes, the encoder denotes a rather loose connection – the slur (or tie) is attached to a certain position in the measure, not to a specific note or chord. If the encoder wants to specify a close connection to a particular event, the <att>startid</att> and <att>endid</att> attributes may be used instead. Here, the <att>xml:id</att>s of the first and last note of the slur are referenced. This mechanism also allows the crossing of layers and staves.</p>
                  <p>For human readability, it is recommended to encode <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">tie</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">phrase</gi> features in the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> where they begin; that is, in the measure that holds the element referenced by <att>startid</att>. On the other hand, for machine processability, it may be desirable to place <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">tie</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">phrase</gi> elements in the measure <hi rend="italic">where they end</hi> or even in the <hi rend="italic">last measure</hi> regardless of their beginning and ending points in the music. This last option makes all references contained within these elements ‘back references’. Back references are necessary when using processing software that treats the encoded file as a stream; that is, programs that process the file without creating an in-memory representation of its contents.</p>
                  <p>When using the <gi scheme="MEI">tie</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">phrase</gi> elements, the curvature of the line may be described using the <att>curvedir</att>, <att>bulge</att> and <att>bezier</att> attributes. Whereas the first attribute allows only specification of the slur’s vertical placement, the others give increasingly more precise control of the curve.</p>
                  <p>If the encoder wishes to draw attention to the appearance of a slur or tie in a given source, the <att>facs</att> attribute may be used instead of (or in addition to) the curve description attributes to point to a graphic image or a zone within an image (see <ptr target="#facsimiles"/>).</p>

                  <p>Common Music Notation provides two different methodologies for expressing the volume of a note, phrase, section, etc. The first is a verbal instruction providing such information in human language, possibly in an abbreviated form. An example is the word <hi rend="italic">piano</hi>, indicating a quiet volume, often abbreviated as <hi rend="italic">p</hi>.

                  <p>Dynamics which do not have an explicit endpoint are often referred to as ‘instantaneous’. On the other hand, some dynamic directions indicate a continuous change that must have a defined end point. It is possible to specify the logical scope of continuous dynamic marks using the attributes <att>tstamp2</att>, <att>dur</att>, <att>dur.ges</att>, or <att>endid</att>. Additionally a corresponding ending value for MIDI output may be given in the <att>val2</att> attribute.</p>

                  <p>Tuplets indicate a localized change of meter; that is, a given duration in the regular meter is divided between a group of notes with irregular (according to the current meter) rhythmic values. The most common tuplet is a so-called ‘triplet’, in which three notes take the time normally occupied by two.</p>
                  <p>The relation of the tuplet to the underlying meter is specified using the <att>num</att> and <att>numbase</att> attributes, where <att>num</att> specifies the number of replacing notes and <att>numbase</att> specifies the number of notes <hi rend="italic">of the same duration</hi> to be replaced. For example, when three eighth notes replace one quarter note in common time, <att>num</att> takes a value of "3", whereas <att>numbase</att> reads "2", because a quarter note in common time is normally divided into two eighths. When three quarters replace two in the same meter, <att>numbase</att> also reads "2". The combination of these attributes may be read as "3 in the time of 2" in either case.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Tuplets are often highlighted using brackets above or below the affected notes. The presence and position of these brackets can be encoded using the <att>bracket.place</att> (above / below) and <att>bracket.visible</att> (true / false) attributes.</p>
                  <p>Usually, however, tuplets are rendered with a bracket (<att>bracket.visible</att>="true") and a single number (<att>num.format</att>="count" and <att>num.visible</att>="true"), as seen in the example above. However, the number-to-numbase ratio may be provided in addition to, or in some cases as a replacement for, the bracket. The <att>num.format</att> attribute indicates whether a plain number (the value of <att>num</att>) or a ratio (comprised of <att>num</att> and <att>numbase</att>, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, "3:2") should be displayed and <att>num.visible</att> indicates the general presence of such a number.</p>
                  <p>Further visual control comes with the <att>num.place</att> and <att>bracket.place</att> attributes, that allow specific placement of the number and the bracket <val>above</val> or <val>below</val> the staff.</p>
                  <p>In addition to <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> elements, <gi scheme="MEI">tuplet</gi> may contain other elements, such as <gi scheme="MEI">rest</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">space</gi>, to match the content of a source document or an intended rendering. In particular, the <gi scheme="MEI">beam</gi> element is allowed so that custom beaming may be indicated, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, a septuplet may be divided into a group of three plus a group of four notes.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">tuplet</gi> element may also be used for repetition of the same pitch; that is, a single note or chord may be the only content of the tuplet. In some cases, optical music recognition software may treat these instances as bowed tremolandi due to the knowledge of the complete semantics of the notation at the time of recognition. However, marking these as tuplets is the recommended practice.</p>
                  <p>In some situations, a tuplet is made up of events in different measures. As this raises the issue of non-concurrent hierarchies, it is not possible to encode such situations with the <gi scheme="MEI">tuplet</gi> element described above. Therefore, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">tupletSpan</gi> element, which is member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class. It is nested inside of <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, following all the measure’s <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> children. It uses the same attributes as <gi scheme="MEI">tuplet</gi> to describe tuplets, but instead of nesting all affected notes inside itself, it references the <att>xml:id</att> values of all affected notes in its <att>plist</att> attribute and the initial and terminal notes of the tuplet using <att>startid</att> and <att>endid</att> attributes. This configuration allows tuplets to cross beams or measure boundaries. The following example demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing tuplets:</p>

                     <p>In CMN, the notes of a chord are sometimes performed successively rather than simultaneously. This behavior, called arpeggiation, is normally indicated using a vertical wavy line preceding the chord. MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">arpeg</gi> element to describe arpeggios. This element is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident> class and, like other members of this class, uses the <att>staff</att>, <att>layer</att> and <att>tstamp</att> or the <att>startid</att> and <att>plist</att> attributes to connect it to the affected chord.</p>

                     <p>For arpeggios that involve chords spanning multiple staves as a continuous arpeggio (instead of two separate arpeggios), the <att>plist</att> attribute should be used to point to all affected <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi> and single <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> elements’ <att>xml:id</att> attributes. Therefore, the use of the <att>plist</att> attribute is sufficient in many cases, so that other attributes from above may be omitted.</p>

                     <p>The usual direction for the performance of an arpeggio is from lowest note to highest, but this is not always the case. The customary signal of an downward arpeggio is an arrowhead added to the bottom of the wavy line. The indication of the presence of an arrowhead and the direction of the arpeggio are handled separately, however. The <att>arrow</att> attribute indicates the presence of an arrowhead in the arpeggiation sign, while the <att>order</att> attribute records the preferred sequence of notes. <name ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</name> uses a wavy line behind the chord to indicate a downward arpeggio. In such cases, the <att>ho</att> attribute can be used to indicate the offset from the usual position.</p>
                     <p>The following examples illustrate various ways in which the arrow and order attributes may be employed. The default visual rendition and performance are assumed in the absence of both attributes, while the typical downward arpeggio is indicated by the presence of both attributes. The last two possibilities occur less frequently, but are sometimes appropriate: The presence of the arrow attribute without the order attribute may be used in those cases where the arrowhead is redundant but is added to the symbol for the sake of consistency or when the direction of successive arpeggios changes frequently. The last possibility, an order attribute without an arrow attribute, is ambiguous; however, it can be used as an encoding shortcut since a downward arpeggio must have a visual indication of its direction to distinguish it from the upward arpeggio; therefore, the presence of the arrowhead can be implied.</p>

                     <p>A third, and somewhat counter-intuitive, value for <att>order</att>, <val>nonarp</val>, indicates that no arpeggio shall be performed. Normally rendered as a bracket instead of a wavy line, this form of arpeggio is used to indicate a non-arpeggiated chord intervening in a sequence of arpeggiated ones. This is common in music for the harp, where arpeggiation is the usual method of performing chords and deviation from the norm must be explicitly indicated.</p>
                     <p>Whereas an arpeggio ‘staggers’ the onset times of the notes of a chord, a glissando denotes a situation where the pitch ‘slides’ from one note to another. It makes no difference whether this slide produces distinct intermediate pitches (as on the piano) or not (as on the trombone), though the latter is sometimes referred to as portamento. The visual appearance of a glissando, which MEI encodes as <gi scheme="MEI">gliss</gi>, is normally a line connecting two notes in the glissando.</p>

                     <p>CMN has two slightly different concepts which are both called tremolo. The first is a rapid repetition of a single pitch or chord, whereas the second is a rapid alternation between two different notes or chords. In addition, either species of tremolo may be measured or unmeasured. A measured tremolo is an abbreviation for written-out notation; that is, the tremolo is intended to be perceived as notes with distinct rhythmic values. On the other hand, in an unmeasured tremolo no specific number of alternations is intended.</p>
                     <p>For the repetition of a single note or chord, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">bTrem</gi> (bowed tremolo) element, which is a member of the <ident type="class">model.eventLike.cmn</ident> class, meaning it is encoded following the normal course of musical events within a <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>.

                     <p>A very common feature of music notation from the CMN period is the so-called ‘fermata’ (or ‘corona’ in Italian). It is usually written as a dot above or below an arc. It may stand above or below the staff it affects with its ‘open’ side usually facing towards the staff. A fermata indicates that a related note or rest should be held longer than its written duration would normally require. Sometimes, a fermata occurs over or under a bar line to indicate a pause or even the end of a phrase or section.</p>

                     <p>Modern harps have seven pedals which allow adjustment of their strings to different pitches. The settings for these pedals occur at the beginning of the harp notation and/or whenever it is necessary to change the harp’s tuning. These settings may be rendered using letter pitches (in the order of the pedals from left to right) or in a diagrammatic fashion, such as the form invented by <name ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Salzedo">Carlos Salzedo</name>.</p>
                     <p>In MEI, harp pedal settings are encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">harpPedal</gi> element. It is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident> class and is therefore placed within <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, following all <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> children. The <att>staff</att> and <att>layer</att> attributes may be used to assign it to a certain <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>. Either a <att>tstamp</att> or <att>startid</att> attribute must be used to indicate the placement within the measure (see <ptr target="#cmnTstamp"/> and <ptr target="#linkingdata"/> for further details about those linking mechanisms).</p>
                     <p>The musical intention of the element is described using the <att>c</att>, <att>d</att>, <att>e</att>, <att>f</att>, <att>g</att>, <att>a</att> and <att>b</att> attributes, which affect the corresponding strings of the harp. All of these attributes may take the values <val>f</val> (flat), <val>s</val> (sharp) or <val>n</val> (natural), where a natural is the default value, which is assumed when one of these attributes is not specified.</p>

                     <p>A common feature for keyboard music is fingering, indicating the finger, which should be used to play a single note.

                  <head>Ossia</head>
                  <p>The term ossia, Italian for "or", denotes an alternative for a certain passage which is provided by the composer <hi rend="italic">without any preference</hi> of one alternative over another. An ossia often provides a simpler (easier to perform) version of the original content. Another frequent use case for ossia is the provision of indications about performance practice, such as an alternative version with ornamentation written out in full. In all cases, it is up to the performer to choose between the alternatives.</p>
                  <p>Most often an ossia is rendered above the main staff on a reduced-size staff. Sometimes, however, the alternate material occurs on the same staff as the primary text, but in a separate layer. In this case, the alternative material is usually rendered in small-sized notation on the normal-sized staff. For both situations, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">ossia</gi> element, which may be nested either inside <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> to reflect an ossia on a separate staff, or inside <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> to reflect an inline ossia in a separate layer. The following example demonstrates an ossia on a separate staff:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>

                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>The example above demonstrates that only one of the two <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> elements within <gi scheme="MEI">ossia</gi> has an <att>n</att> attribute. This mechanism allows one to distinguish between the "regular" and the "alternative" content: The one bearing the <att>n</att> attribute goes in line with the preceding measure’s staff, the other one is printed in reduced size above. In this case, the vertical order of staves follows document order: The top-most staff is encoded as the first child, the lowest comes last. In combination with the presence of the <att>n</att> attribute, this allows the capture of multiple simultaneous ossia staves.</p>
                  <p>All staves within <gi scheme="MEI">ossia</gi>, even the alternative ones without a direct reference, obey the definitions of the associated <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>, which can be derived from the value of the <att>n</att> attribute. Alternatively, a separate <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> may be given at the beginning of the contained <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> element(s).</p>
                  <p>In case of an inline ossia, the whole setup of elements moves down one step in the hierarchy, as seen in the following example:</p>

                  <p>Cue notes are smaller notes that usually occur in an orchestral or vocal part and are not to be played or sung by the corresponding musician, but by other instruments or singers. Cue notes are used for orientation, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, to follow the music during longer pauses and to find the correct re-entry point more easily. In MEI the <att>cue</att> attribute is available to indicate such notes.</p>

                     <p>A tempo or character indication is often provided above the topmost staff of the first measure of a score, movement, or section. This indication, such as "Allegro moderato" or "Andante maestoso", may be regarded as a label. Though it is possible to label the movement, etc. using a <att>label</att> attribute attached to the enclosing structural entity (that is, on <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi>), it is often required to capture the exact position, spelling, or other features of the label as found in the underlying source material.

                     <p>Rehearsal marks are another specialized kind of directive. Consisting of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, rehearsal marks are used in scores and corresponding performer parts to identify convenient points to restart rehearsal after breaks or interruptions. For this reason, they are often visually emphasized by placing them within a square or circle. In MEI, they are encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">reh</gi> element, which holds the textual content of the rehearsal mark. It is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident> class. The visual rendition of the rehearsal mark, including the surrounding shape, may be captured using the <gi scheme="MEI">rend</gi> element described in chapter <ptr target="#sharedTextRendition"/>.</p>

At the same time, composers and engravers of music often use local symbols for repeating smaller portions of music instead of writing them in full more than once. In this case, the repetition is better defined as a species of abbreviation.</p>

                     <head>Measure-Level Repetition Symbols</head>
                     <p>In addition to repetition at the section level, CMN includes a number of different symbols for measure-level repetitions. Many of these symbols are found in manuscripts and may be regarded as personal conventions of their respective authors. Some signs, however, have been widely adopted. For example, it is common to indicate the repetition of a single beat or an entire measure with one or more diagonal lines, sometimes with dots at the upper left and lower right, much like a percent sign. The illustration below contains the most common signs:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head>Beat repeat signs</head>

                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>In general, MEI places primary emphasis on the capture of the semantic meaning of symbols, not their visual rendition. In this case, the focus is on the material being repeated, for example, a beat, a measure, a 2-measure fragment, etc. The following elements are provided for this purpose:</p>
                     <p>
                        <specList>
                           <specDesc key="beatRpt"/>
                           <specDesc key="halfmRpt"/>
                           <specDesc key="mRpt"/>
                           <specDesc key="mRpt2"/>
                           <specDesc key="multiRpt"/>
                        </specList>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">beatRpt</gi> element is used to represent a single repeated beat. Its visual rendition can be recorded using the <att>slash</att> attribute. This attribute indicates the number of slashes required to render the appropriate repeat symbol, which, as demonstrated in the preceding figure, depends on the rhythmic content of the beat being repeated. When a beat that consists of a single note or chord is repeated, the repetition sign is typically rendered as a single thick, slanting slash; therefore, the value <val>1</val> should be used. The following values should be used when the beat is divided into even notes: 4ths or 8ths=1, 16ths=2, 32nds=3, 64ths=4, 128ths=5. When the beat is comprised of mixed duration values, the symbol is always rendered as 2 slashes and 2 dots.</p>
                     <p>In addition to its indication of a repeated beat, the beatRpt element is sometimes used in popular music notation, especially in guitar or percussion parts, to indicate a repeated rhythmic pattern. The <gi scheme="MEI">beatRpt</gi> element can be used, but when these parts require durations longer or shorter than a beat, note elements with appropriately-shaped note heads should be employed instead.</p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt</gi> element is available for repetition of an entire measure. Like <gi scheme="MEI">mRest</gi>, it must be the sole child of <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>, no other events should be used. The <att>n</att> attribute of <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt</gi> should not be used to record the number displayed above the measure in the figure below. Instead, the numbering of repetitions of the written-out measure can be enabled using the <att>multi.number</att> attribute available on the <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> elements.</p>

                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">halfmRpt</gi> element represents the incorrect, but frequently found, use of the measure repeat (or similar) sign to indicate repetition of half of a measure. This practice mostly occurs in hand-written notation and usually involves the repetition of the second half of a measure in duple time. This element is necessary because the function of the symbol, not the visual symbol itself, is of primary importance. The following example from the beginning of Beethoven’s <hi rend="italic">Waldstein</hi> sonata illustrates such usage:</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>As seen in the example above, it is possible to continuously repeat half measures, even across bar lines.</p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt2</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">multiRpt</gi> elements (like the <gi scheme="MEI">multiRest</gi> element) never occur in scores, only in performer parts, where it is often necessary to abbreviate the notation due to page size limitations.</p>

                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt2</gi> element represents repetition of a 2-measure fragment, while <gi scheme="MEI">multiRpt</gi> is for repetition of fragments longer than two measures. In modern publishing practice, repeats of more than two measures are written out using repeat signs. This element is provided, however, for handling non-standard practices often found in manuscripts. The <att>num</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">multiRpt</gi> records the number of preceding measures to be repeated.</p>
                     <p>All elements described above allow for association of the sign with a symbol in a digital facsimile (via the <att>facs</att> attribute) and with a user-defined symbol (using <att>altsym</att>). See <ptr target="#facsimiles"/> and <ptr target="#userSymbols"/> for further details. In addition, the <att>expand</att> attribute is available on the foregoing elements to inform a rendering process whether to use the repeat symbol or the full content represented by it. A value of <val>true</val> indicates that the content should be displayed, while a <val>false</val> value means to show only the repeat symbol.</p>

               <head>Common Music Notation Ornaments</head>
               <p>This module includes elements and attributes for the encoding of ornaments typical of ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN). Ornaments are formulae of embellishment that can be realized by adding supplementary notes to one or more notes of the melody. In written form, these are usually expressed as symbols written above or below a note, though some have a more complex written expression, such as those that involve multiple notes and/or include grace notes.</p>
               <p>These symbols may have different resolutions depending on a large number of factors, such as historical context, national boundaries, composer, scribe, etc. The elements described here, therefore, are not bound to a specific symbol; they are, instead, meant to encode the encoder’s interpretation of a symbol and its position on the staff.</p>
               <p>Nonetheless, in order to establish common ground, the guidelines suggest commonly accepted symbols and realizations for the ornaments supported by MEI.</p>
               <p>The following sections will introduce each element in detail for all types of ornaments supported.</p>
               <div xml:id="cmnOrnamentsAll" type="div3">
                  <head>Encoding Common To All Ornaments</head>
                  <p>When encoding CMN, ornaments should be encoded within a <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, following the <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> elements, and connected to events on the staff via attributes. The <att>startid</att> attribute is used to refer to the <att>xml:id</att> of the starting note. Additionally, if the ornament involves more than one events on the staff, the <att>endid</att> attribute can be used to anchor the ornament to a concluding event.</p>
                  <p>The following example demonstrates the encoding of a mordent over a middle C:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample192.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alternatively, the relationship of an ornament to a note can be expressed in terms of beats with the attribute <att>tstamp</att>. If the ornament involves more than one event on the staff, the <att>tstamp2</att> attribute can be used to indicate the ending time stamp, as is explained in section <ptr target="#cmnTstamp"/>. These methods may also be utilized simultaneously.</p>
                  <p>The following example shows the use of <att>tstamp</att> for an ornament. Assuming that the following measure is in 2/2, the ornament (in this case, a mordent) is related to the note on the second beat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample193.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>The relationship between an ornament and the notes on staff must always be encoded. It is, in fact, a semantic error not to specify a starting event or time stamp for an ornament.</p>
                  <p>In their resolution, ornaments will involve auxiliary notes, which typically follow the key signature or the scale of the current key. When the ornament involves other chromatic auxiliaries, an accidental is expressed next to or above the ornament sign. The attributes <att>accidlower</att> and <att>accidupper</att>, available on all ornaments described in this chapter, can be used to record this accidental. The attribute values ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ indicate whether the accidental is associated with an upper or lower auxiliary note, not the position of the accidental sign.</p>

                     <head>Overriding Default Resolutions</head>
                     <p>The symbols and sounded resolutions suggested for each ornament in this chapter are to be considered defaults. Nevertheless, because of the great historical and geographical variance in the notation of ornaments, the encoder is given methods to override the default resolutions.</p>
                     <p>It is possible, for example, to specify in the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> a new default sounded resolution for an ornament. As discussed in the section <ptr target="#headerEncodingDescription"/>, the element <gi scheme="MEI">encodingDesc</gi> holds a description (optional, but recommended) of the methods and editorial principles which govern the transcription or encoding of the source material. Let us take a trill as an example. The section regarding <ptr target="#cmnOrnamentsTrills"/> does not set a specific number of alternations between the principal and secondary notes; the encoder, however, may specify an exact number in the encoding description.</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>

                     </p>
                     <p>Alternatively, resolutions can be defined on a case-by-case basis by encoding a specific resolution using the <gi scheme="MEI">choice</gi> element. See the section <ptr target="#cmnOrnamentsTrillsSpecial"/> below for an example of a specific resolution of a trill.</p>

                  <head>Mordents</head>
                  <p>A mordent is an ornament that involves an auxiliary note a step above or below the principal note. The presence of a mordent is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">mordent</gi> element and its attributes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="mordent"/>

                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute <att>form</att> to encode the typology of mordents. Two common types are supported: those mordents that involve a note lower than the principal note, and those that involve a note higher than the principal note.</p>
                  <p>The attribute <att>form</att> accepts the following values:</p>
                  <list type="gloss">
                     <label>upper</label>
                     <item>usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic rend="smufl" url="https://edirom.de/smufl-browser/E56C.png"/>. This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its upper neighbor, with a return to the principal note.</item>
                     <label>lower</label>
                     <item>usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic rend="smufl" url="https://edirom.de/smufl-browser/E56D.png"/>. This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its lower neighbor, with a return to the principal note.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple mordents:</p>

                  <p>Trills are a type of ornament that consists of a rapid alternation of a note with one a semitone or tone above. A trill is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">trill</gi> element and its attributes:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Trills in modern notation are usually expressed with the abbreviation "tr" above a note on the staff. Often the abbreviation is followed by a wavy line that indicates the length of the trill.</p>
                  <p>The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple trills:</p>

Specifying the end point is not required, although the <att>tstamp2</att> or <att>endid</att> attribute may be used to imply the use of a wavy line extender as shown in this example:</p>

                  <p>When giving an end point to trills, the <att>extender</att> attribute should also be added, to indicate the presence or absence of a line extender. Notice, that the note referenced in <att>endid</att> is not part of the trill itself, just like in <ref target="#cmnArpegGliss">glissandos</ref>.</p>
                  <p>Chromatic alterations of auxiliary notes are occasionally expressed on the staff using small notes enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the example below. However, the attribute <att>accidupper</att> is still to be used to encode the alteration. Display of the auxiliary note in this ‘cautionary’ manner is left to down-stream rendering processes.</p>

                  <p>Some trills may be introduced by a turn or followed by an inverted turn leading to the next note (see Le garzantine, Musica 2003, p. 911). In such cases, the trill is encoded as in previous examples and associated with the principal note. Starting or concluding turns are notated on the staff (in <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>) as <ptr target="#cmnNotesGrace"/>.</p>
                  <p>The following example, from a keyboard sonata by Joseph Haydn, shows a trill with concluding grace notes (called <hi rend="italic">Nachschlag</hi>):</p>

                     <p>Symbols and abbreviations for trills have changed and evolved considerably throughout history. Strategies to clarify the encoding and interpretation of ornaments have been discussed in section <ptr target="#cmnOrnamentsOverride"/> above. However, in order to aid the encoder in making educated choices in the encoding of non-standard trills, this section shows two examples diverging from modern standard use.</p>
                     <p>The abbreviation "tr" followed by a wavy line spanning multiple notes is sometimes used to indicate multiple trills:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>The encoding of this kind of trill may vary depending on the purpose of the encoding. For representation of the source, a single trill is sufficient:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample201.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>To support analytical and aural rendering applications, however, each trill may be explicitly encoded, as the following example demonstrates:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample202.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, when it is necessary to support multiple outputs, use of the <gi scheme="MEI">choice</gi> element and appropriate sub-elements is recommended. In this case, the <gi scheme="MEI">orig</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">reg</gi> elements can be used to represent the original source and a regularization provided by the editor, respectively:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample203.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another situation that requires disambiguation of an ornament’s name and its potential rendition is due to the fact that the symbols for trills and mordents have been often used interchangeably in the past. The following example, taken from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klavierbüchlein_für_Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach">
                           <hi rend="italic">Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</hi>
                        </ref> (1720), shows a trill (<hi rend="italic">Trillo</hi>) identified by the symbol associated with a mordent in modern practice. Nonetheless, J.S. Bach’s suggested resolution should be encoded with a variant of the procedure presented above.</p>
                     <p>In the example below, the child elements of <gi scheme="MEI">choice</gi>; that is, <gi scheme="MEI">orig</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">reg</gi>, represent non-exclusive options; that is, both may be processed by applications that aim to support both visual and aural renditions.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Depending on the purpose of the encoding, it may be more convenient to encode the regularized text within the stream of events, along with a corresponding choice with regard to the existence of the trill marking, as in the following example:</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">orig</gi> element contains the single-note-with-trill transcription of the original text, while the <gi scheme="MEI">reg</gi> element represents the realization-without-trill version.</p>
                     <p>This approach facilitates substitution of the realization of the trill for the original written note (as well as the opposite procedure) and is therefore the recommended markup for applications where exchange of this kind is desirable.</p>

                  <head>Turns</head>
                  <p>A turn is an ornament that typically consists of four notes: the upper neighbor of the principal note, the principal note, the lower neighbor, and the principal note again.</p>
                  <p>The presence of a turn is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">turn</gi> element and its attributes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="att.turn.log" atts="form delayed"/>
                        <specDesc key="att.ornamentAccid" atts="accidlower accidupper"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute <att>form</att> to encode the typology of the turn.</p>
                  <p>The attribute <att>form</att> accepts the following values:</p>
                  <list type="gloss">
                     <label>upper</label>
                     <item>usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic rend="smufl" url="https://edirom.de/smufl-browser/E567.png"/>. This turn is commonly performed beginning on a note higher than the principal note.</item>
                     <label>lower</label>
                     <item>usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic rend="smufl" url="https://edirom.de/smufl-browser/E568.png"/>. This turn is commonly performed beginning on a note lower than the principal note.</item>
                  </list>

                  <p>Turns can sometimes be performed after the principal note (usually on the second half of the beat, see Read 1979, p. 246) and leading to the following event. To indicate this, the turn symbol is typically written in between the principal note and the next. These kind of turns are encoded with the attribute <att>delayed</att>.</p>
                  <p>The following example from Beethoven’s piano sonata no. 1 in F minor, op. 2, no. 1, mvmt. 2 demonstrates the encoding of turns with the <att>delayed</att> attribute. Note that the <att>tstamp</att> attribute indicates the actual starting point in time, while <att>startid</att> points to the principal note.</p>

                  <p>CMN ornaments that are not mordents, trills, or turns can be encoded with a generic <gi scheme="MEI">ornam</gi>.</p>
                  <p>This element allows the encoder to represent ornaments as textual strings (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, with a Unicode symbol) or with a user defined symbol. Chromatic auxiliaries can be represented with <att>accidlower</att> and <att>accidupper</att>. The <gi scheme="MEI">ornam</gi> element can also be a control element. That is, it can be linked via its attributes to other events. The starting point of the directive may be indicated by either a tstamp, tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid attribute, while the ending point may be recorded by either a tstamp2, dur, dur.ges or endid attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute.</p>

                  <p>Particularly in baroque keyboard music, but also in the early classical period, various combinations of ornaments can be found. Despite being written vertically above the same note, they are to be performed in sequence.</p>
                  <p>The following example from <name ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach">Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach’s</name> song <hi rend="italic">Dorinde</hi> Wq 199/7 shows a turn followed by a inverted mordent:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When encoding the example above, both ornaments will be positioned above the same note. The encoded order of the elements, moreover, may correspond to the performed sequence, which in this example is top to bottom: first the turn, then the mordent. As every renderer deals differently with such combined ornaments it is best practice to encode the performed sequence additionally with <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes. The visual order can be specified globally with <att>aboveorder</att> in the preceding <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>.</p>
