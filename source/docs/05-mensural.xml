            <head>Repertoire: Mensural Notation</head>
            <p>This chapter describes the module for encoding mensural notation from the late 13th century to about 1600. Historically, mensural notation preceded the development of Common Music Notation (CMN) and it included a wide range of features that persist in CMN and that can be encoded in a standard manner in MEI. In mensural notation, pitches are notated as in CMN, leaving out here the major exception of <hi rend="italic">musica ficta</hi>. The pitch is given by the position of the note on the staff and the current clef as in CMN, and the mensural module introduces no modification to MEI regarding how pitches are encoded.</p>
            <p>There are a number of differences, however, in the representation of duration in mensural notation. The mensural module introduces specific attribute values for notes and rests for appropriately encoding mensural durations. One of the main differences is that the duration of a note is not determined by its symbol, but also by the meter and the context in which the symbol appears in relation to other notes and rests in the same voice. The meter is given by one of the 16 mensural <hi rend="italic">species</hi> provided by four levels of division: <hi rend="italic">modus major</hi>, <hi rend="italic">modus minor</hi>, <hi rend="italic">tempus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prolatio</hi>. In the case of triple meter and depending on the specific context where the note is positioned, certain rules must be applied in order to determine the duration of a note. In these cases, encoding both the sign and its actual duration is highly recommended (as will be shown in <ptr target="#mensuralNotes"/>).</p>
            <p>Another difference is the use of proportions that are indicated by numeric ratios or by specific mensuration signs. The proportions indicate that the durations have to be modified and they may be combined. Proportions and mensuration signs were eventually simplified and became time signatures in CMN. The attributes and elements available in this module for encoding mensural signs and proportions can be found below (see <ptr target="#mensuralSigns"/> and <ptr target="#mensuralProportions"/>).</p>
            <p>In mensural notation, notes can also be notated in ligatures that regroup two or more notes. Ligatures were a legacy from an earlier notation system that were still widely used in Renaissance music notation. They gradually disappeared during the seventeenth century. The mensural module provides multiple ways of encoding the ligatures.</p>

               <p>When the mensural module is included, <att>dur</att> on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">rest</gi>, and other elements takes the following values (from the Latin names of notes):</p>

               <p>Normally, <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> rests are vertical strokes occupying two or three spaces in the staff, depending on the mensuration. For instance, in <att>modusminor</att>="3", they take up three spaces; and in <att>modusminor</att>="2", they take two. However, there are situations where both types of <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> rests can be present in the same piece, regardless of the <hi rend="italic">modus minor</hi>. For this reason, the <att>dur</att> attribute can take on two other values when used within <gi scheme="MEI">rest</gi> elements:</p>
               <list type="gloss">
                  <label>2B</label>

                  <head>Alteration and Imperfection</head>
                  <p>In ternary mensurations, the ambiguity between the note shape and its actual duration requires specific attention. The rules of mensural notation can require the alteration or the imperfection of a note; that is, an increase or reduction in its performed duration. In these cases, if the encoding is intended to be used for more than just graphically representing the notation, encoding only the note shape by means of the <att>dur</att> attribute alone is insufficient. In that case, in addition to encoding the duration sign in the <att>dur</att> attribute, it is recommended to encode its performed duration in the <att>dur.quality</att> attribute. The <att>dur.quality</att> attribute specifies the length of a note according to the contextual rules of mensural notation. Its values, listed below, are adopted from the original Latin terms:</p>
                  <list type="gloss">
                     <label>perfecta</label>
                     <item>Three times the duration of the note in the next smaller degree</item>
                     <label>imperfecta</label>
                     <item>Two times the duration of the note in the next smaller degree</item>
                     <label>altera</label>
                     <item>Twice the original duration of the note (only usable in perfect mensurations)</item>
                     <label>minor</label>
                     <item>Category of a regular semibrevis in Ars antiqua, equivalent to a third of a brevis</item>
                     <label>maior</label>
                     <item>Category of an altered semibrevis in Ars antiqua, equivalent to two minor semibrevis</item>
                     <label>duplex</label>
                     <item>One of the three categories of a longa in Ars antiqua ('duplex', 'perfecta', and 'imperfecta')</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The last three values are to be used exclusively in <hi rend="italic">Ars antiqua</hi> mensural notation, where <val>maior</val> and <val>minor</val> refer to types of <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>, and <val>duplex</val> refers to a type of <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>. Examples of each of these six values are presented below. In these examples, the ‘voice’ staff renders the notes in the code snippet, and the ‘reference’ staff, together with the dotted bar lines, are shown to help to visualize the relative values of the notes in the ‘voice’ staff.</p>
                  <p>The following example illustrates an <hi rend="italic">alteration</hi> (the second <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi>) in <hi rend="italic">modus minor perfectus</hi>. Notice that the second <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi> has doubled its regular value, it has been altered, unlike the first one. <figure>
                        <head>Example of alteration (The bottom staff, together with the dotted barlines, is used here to help visualizing the durational values of the notes in the upper staff)</head>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is possible to omit the <att>dur.quality</att> attribute in a note when the performed duration of the note is the default value provided by the mensuration. In this case, the <hi rend="italic">longas</hi> are perfect, just as the mensuration (<hi rend="italic">perfect modus minor</hi>) indicates. Therefore, the <att>dur.quality</att> attribute can be omitted for the two <hi rend="italic">longas</hi>. <figure>
                        <head>Example omitting <att>dur.quality</att> for default values provided by the mensuration</head>

                     </figure> The same applies to the examples that follow.</p>
                  <p>The following example illustrates an <hi rend="italic">imperfection</hi> (the two <hi rend="italic">longae</hi>) in <hi rend="italic">modus minor perfectus</hi> with the same <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>-<hi rend="italic">brevis</hi>-<hi rend="italic">brevis</hi>-<hi rend="italic">longa</hi> sequence but with an additional <hi rend="italic">dot of division</hi> between the two <hi rend="italic">breves</hi> (see <ptr target="#dots"/> for more details). Notice that here the <hi rend="italic">longae</hi> have been imperfected, unlike the previous example in which they kept the perfect value indicated by the mensuration. <figure>
                        <head>Example of imperfection (The bottom staff, together with the dotted barlines, is used here to help visualizing the durational values of the notes in the upper staff)</head>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="verovio code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/verovio/imperfection.mei" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following example in <hi rend="italic">modus minor imperfectus</hi> illustrates the use of a dot of augmentation following the <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> (see <ptr target="#dots"/> for more details). Notice that the <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>, which is supposed to be imperfect according to the mensuration, has a perfect value due to the augmentation dot. <figure>
                        <head>Example of augmentation (The bottom staff, together with the dotted barlines, is used here to help visualizing the durational values of the notes in the upper staff)</head>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="verovio code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/verovio/augmentation.mei" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, the following example illustrates the <att>dur.quality</att> values related to the <hi rend="italic">Ars antiqua</hi> style, for <hi rend="italic">perfect modus</hi>, with the breve equivalents notated in the lower staff for reference (as in the previous examples). <figure>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Ars Antiqua</hi>, only the <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> could be "perfecta" / "imperfecta" and the <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi> could have a regular value ("recta") or be "altera". In the <hi rend="italic">Ars nova</hi>, principles of imperfection and alteration were extended into the other note levels (<hi rend="italic">brevis</hi>-<hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>-<hi rend="italic">minima</hi>). This means that the <hi rend="italic">breves</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Ars antiqua</hi> do not have a "perfecta" / "imperfecta" quality, and this is why there is no <att>dur.quality</att> attribute for the <hi rend="italic">breves</hi> in the previous example. However, the <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi> can have a ternary division (indicated by <att>tempus</att>="3"), being divided either into three (equal) <hi rend="italic">minor semibreves</hi> or into a <hi rend="italic">minor</hi>-<hi rend="italic">maior</hi> pair of <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>. The encoding also allows for the possibility of encoding a binary division of the breve in <hi rend="italic">Ars antiqua</hi> notations: the indication <att>tempus</att>="2" indicates the breve is divided into two equal <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>. This is why in this example with <att>tempus</att>="3", the <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi> do have a <att>dur.quality</att> attribute (with values <val>minor</val> or <val>maior</val>).</p>
                  <p>An alternative encoding---removing the <att>dur.quality</att> attributes for notes which lengths are not modified from their default values (<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the perfect long and the minor <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>)---would be: <figure>

                  <p>The conjunct use of the <att>dur</att> and <att>dur.quality</att> attributes is generally enough to encode the duration of a note—and, as indicated before, one could even remove <att>dur.quality</att> when its value is in agreement with the mensuration. However, there are cases (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, partial imperfection) where the values of <att>dur.quality</att> are not enough to provide the note’s duration.</p>

                  <head>Partial Imperfection</head>
                  <p>In opposition to regular imperfection, which is caused by a note of the next smaller degree (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, a perfect <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi> imperfected by a following/preceding <hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>), partial imperfection is caused by a note of two or even three orders apart. As an example, consider an imperfect <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> made up of two perfect <hi rend="italic">breves</hi>. This <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> can be ‘partially imperfected’ by a following/preceding <hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>. This <hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi> causes part of the <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>—one of its perfect <hi rend="italic">breves</hi>—to be imperfected, taking away one-third of one of its two halves. In this case, the <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>’s value changes from 6 <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi> (two perfect <hi rend="italic">breves</hi>) into 5 <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>. Partial imperfection is not supported by the <att>dur.quality</att> attribute—because there can be many cases of partial imperfection, as will be seen in the following examples. To encode a partial imperfection, the <att>num</att> and <att>numbase</att> pair of attributes are used instead. Given the change in the <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>’s value from 6 <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi> to 5 <hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>, the corresponding attributes to encode this particular case of partial imperfection would be <att>num</att>="6" and <att>numbase</att>="5" as shown below in the code snippet and its rendering.</p>

                  <p>The values of the <att>notationtype</att> attribute can indicate notation types other than mensural, such as common (Western) music notation, neume notation, and tablature.</p>
                  <p>The attribute <att>notationsubtype</att> can be used, together with the <att>notationtype</att> attribute, to provide more specificity regarding the type of notation encoded. This attribute can be used, for example, to specify if a piece in black mensural notation (<att>notationtype</att>="mensural.black") is written in <hi rend="italic">Ars antiqua</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ars nova</hi> style. Currently, the values allowed in the <att>notationsubtype</att> attribute consist of any sequence of characters provided by the user.</p>

                  <p>Dots of division and augmentation can be encoded by using the <gi scheme="MEI">dot</gi> element (provided by the MEI.shared module). This element is meant to be used as a child of <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> following the <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">rest</gi> after which it appears in the original source.</p> 
                  <p>Dots in mensural notation are not encoded as children of notes or rests, but rather as a sibling of these. They are also not encoded as attributes (the use of the <att>dot</att> attribute in a <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">rest</gi> element is only acceptable in Common Music Notation, not mensural).</p>
                  <p>To indicate the nature of the dot (as a dot of division or augmentation), the <gi scheme="MEI">dot</gi> element has an attribute <att>form</att>, which can take on the following values:</p>
                  <list type="gloss">
                     <label>aug</label>
                     <item>Value of the form attribute for a dot of augmentation (this is a dot that adds half the value to the previous note, like a dotted note in common Western music notation)</item>
                     <label>div</label>
                     <item>Value of the form attribute for a dot of division (this is a dot that modifies the perfect groupings of the notes, thus, changing some notes' duration in the process)</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The actual effect of these dots (<hi rend="italic">augmenting</hi> a note and making it perfect, or dividing a sequence of notes in different groupings by <hi rend="italic">imperfecting</hi> some notes or <hi rend="italic">altering</hi> others) is encoded with the <att>dur.quality</att> attribute of the correspoding <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> elements.
