            <p>This chapter describes the elements, model classes, and attribute classes that are part of the MEI.neumes module.</p>

               <head>Overview of the Neumes Module</head>
               <p>The MEI Neumes Module represents the community’s attempt to create a standardized set of rules that encapsulate in a logical, systematic, and unequivocal way the musical information represented and conveyed by Western European neumatic notations (beginning with the late ninth century and continuing to the printed books of the twentieth). Most neume notation is used to set music to an existing text. The syllable is the fundamental unit of structure, with the neumes themselves serving as a means of “sonifying” the text. A syllable may be expressed via one or more neumes, with the particular neume shape chosen depending on the pitch contour that is being employed and the desired interpretation.</p>
               <p>The `syllable` element is used as the primary organizational element for neume notation within a `layer` element. Within `syllable`, the `syl` element defined in the `MEI.shared` module is used for encoding the textual content, while the `neume` and `nc` elements are used to encode the neumes themselves. Within these Neumes Module elements, other standard MEI mechanisms are available to accommodate, for example, editorial or critical markup.</p>

                  <head>Basic four elements</head>
                  <p>The following four elements are the fundamental components of the Neumes Module:</p>

                  <p>Neume notation can be thought of as "neumed text". Therefore, the syllable element provides high-level organization in this repertoire.</p>

               <head>Neumes Module Background</head>
               <p>Neume encoding in MEI was initially developed as part of the <ref target="https://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/tuebingen_e.php">Hildegard von Bingen project</ref> at the University of Tübingen. MEI was chosen as the basic representation format after a <ref target="http://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/tuebingen_phase1_e.php">comparison of existing music encoding formats</ref>. The initial work on this module was performed by Gregor Schräder <ref target="http://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/studienarbeit.pdf">(Ein XML-Datenformat zur Repräsentation kritischer Musikedition unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Neumennotation)</ref>, supervised by Prof. Stefan Morent. Since 2012 a group of scholars has been working on the development of a new version of the MEI schema for neume notations (Ichiro Fujinaga, Jennifer Bain, Debra Lacoste, Kate Helsen, and Inga Behrendt). Afterwards, other chant scholars joined the group bringing further expertise on other kinds of early music notations (namely <ref target="https://sites.google.com/fcsh.unl.pt/elsadeluca/">Elsa De Luca</ref>, Alessandra Ignesti, and Sarah A. Long).</p>

               <head>Neume Notation and MEI</head>
               <p>There are four main challenges in encoding Western European early music. The first relates to the fact that early notation was just a mnemonic aid that helped the readers to recall the music they already knew by heart and, as such, it conveys only partial musical information (Bain, Behrendt, &amp; Helsen 2014; Helsen, Behrendt, &amp; Bain 2017). Indeed, it is only with the invention of staff lines in the eleventh century that the system of musical transmission gradually changed, relying more on the written record rather than on orality. The second challenge refers to the existence of different regional styles of early notation; early-music manuscripts display a great graphical variety of musical signs, which include both neumes and other notational elements conveying further musical information (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, significative letters, Old Hispanic ticks, etc.). Thirdly, some of those regional notational styles occasionally share graphically similar shapes; these similar shapes within the different notational styles are understood by modern scholars to represent the same, a similar, or even a <hi rend="italic">different</hi> musical meaning. Finally, while on occasion the neume shapes appear to mirror graphically the musical characteristics of the sound being represented (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, pen-stroke going up = rising melody), in many instances it is generally understood that the meaning attached to the neumes (or the other notational elements) may not be so straight-forward, but instead was ruled by conventions shared by the people who knew orally the musical repertory being fixed in written form by means of notation.</p>
              <p><hi rend="italic">What do these challenges entail for modern encoders?</hi></p>
               <p>Firstly, sometimes we have to deal with written signs whose meaning is obscure to us and, while we can infer the meaning of some of those signs from the study of later manuscripts with the same melodies and a more precise notation, in other cases we need to turn to music palaeographers who examine the recurrence of those written signs and the context where they were used. By analysing scribal hands in particular manuscripts, palaeographers can often work out if a written sign is a meaningless scribal variant or a graphical feature conveying musical meaning to the medieval reader. Secondly, since a neume shape could either mirror on the page the aural event or bear some other musical meaning attached by convention, the encoding sometimes relies on the visual level or on the semantic level, and this distinction has to be made on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, since the same written sign could have multiple interpretations according to the style of notation where it was employed, it is crucial to be aware of the conventions of each regional notational alphabet in order to capture the musical information conveyed by that sign in the contexts where it is found.</p>
               <p>See two examples of shapes found in different regional styles that are not captured with the same encoding:</p>

               <p>A further complication is that while the music encoding aims to narrow down and capture the meaning of the neumes in a logical and coherent system, occasionally the significance of some neumes is under debate (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, <gi scheme="MEI">quilisma</gi>) and, despite its aim for accuracy, the encoding must remain open for future interpretations. From all these challenges has arisen the need for an early music encoding standardisation, that is, a set of rules that work for the description of any neume across all early notations regardless of the different methodologies applied to the study of individual notations and their idiosyncrasies.</p>
               <p>Broadly speaking, Western early notations belong to two main categories. On one side we have notations where two or more notes were represented by a single pen-stroke, while on the other side there are notations where the notes are graphically separated by means of discrete dots or short pen-strokes. These distinctions have been described even within single notational styles as gapped or not gapped (Behrendt, Bain, &amp; Helsen 2017). To date, the MEI Neumes Module has been tested mainly on square notations and stroke notations (St. Gall, Old Hispanic, etc.), but also on Aquitanian point-notation.</p>

                  <p>Nota bene: in the last example we can read the exact pitch of the custos because the lozenged punctum (placed one step below the line) signals the lower note of the semitone E-F. This information, combined with the identification of the finalis of the piece, allows us to decipher the mode of this piece, that is the 4th.</p>

                  <p>The following example illustrates the MEI encoding of the opening of Hildegarde’s “O Splendidissima Gemma” with the text “O splendidissima”. This example provides the basic MEI skeleton to have a valid MEI file and it may be used for reference for scholars willing to start encoding early music (and its text) in MEI. Information about the <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> has been omitted for brevity, but it was originally encoded on a 5-line staff with two clefs, a “C” and a “F” on lines 5 and 3, respectively.</p>
