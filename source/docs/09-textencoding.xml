         <div xml:id="textencoding" type="div1">
            <head>Text Encoding</head>
            <p>This chapter describes methods for encoding textual content with MEI. It is divided into section: One part deals with <ptr target="#textstructures"/> in MEI, the other with <ptr target="#text"/>. While the first covers structures of textual documents such as front matter or back matter, the latter describes how to mark up features and various entities within a text, such as names, tables or quotes. These features may appear both within data (a <gi scheme="MEI">fig</gi>ure scribbled as marginal <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi>ation into a score by a bored second violin…) and metadata (a number of <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi>s within a text about the <gi scheme="MEI">creation</gi> of a work). Accordingly, many of the elements and models explained in this chapter are used to encode <ptr target="#metadata"/>. However, they should not be confused with the elements from the <ptr target="#lyricsperfdir"/> chapter, which deals with <hi rend="italic">performed</hi> text in MEI.</p>
            <p>Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal primarily with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). These elements are provided to encode relatively basic textual information. For deeper encoding of text, these Guidelines recommend consideration of other text-specific encoding formats with embedded MEI markup.</p>
            <div xml:id="textstructures" type="div2">
               <head>Text Structures</head>
               <p>This chapter focuses on the text that accompanies the score, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, paratext (prefatory material, back matter, appendices, etc.).</p>
               <div xml:id="textDivisions" type="div3">
                  <head>Organizing Text into Divisions</head>
                  <p>Text can be organized in different parts, for example in chapters or sections. The <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element is used to encode such structural divisions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="div"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, printed scores, before the actual notation, can have text that can be organized in multiple sections (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, a preface, a critical report, performance instructions, etc. for which see the following sections); each of these sections should be identified by a different <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element. Text might also occur in between music sections (see <ptr target="#sharedMdivContent"/>), for example in a collection of romantic piano works, a few pieces might be preceded or followed by poetry. Such text should be encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element, as demonstrated in the following example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample358.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Textual divisions may have titles or other forms of introductory material, which are encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">head</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="head"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following example shows the encoding of a preface translated into three different languages, each with a different heading:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample359.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having said that <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> identifies any structural organization of text, it is often helpful to distinguish the typology of division. The <att>type</att> attribute can be used for this purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="div" atts="type"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <att>type</att> may contain any number of space-separated <hi rend="italic">tags</hi> describing the nature of the <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> (or, in fact, any other element). The following example shows the use of <att>type</att> (in combination with <att>n</att>) to indicate three prefaces in English, German and Italian are columns on the same page.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample360.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                     </figure>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div xml:id="textFrontBack" type="div3">
                  <head>Paratext</head>
                  <p>This section introduces paratextual material, such as title pages, prefaces, indexes and other text that precedes or follows the actual score.</p>
                  <div xml:id="textFront" type="div4">
                     <head>Front Matter</head>
                     <p>By ‘front matter’ these Guidelines mean distinct sections of a text (usually, but not necessarily, a printed one), prefixed to it by way of introduction or identification as a part of its production. Features such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite case might be the prologue attached to a dramatic work. The front matter of an encoded text should not be confused with the MEI header described in chapter <ptr target="#headerstructure"/>, which provides metadata for the entire file.</p>
                     <p>An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text, if the original presentation of the work is of no interest. No specific tags are provided for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear within front matter: instead, generic <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> (“division”) elements may be used, which should not be confused with <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> (“musical division”) elements. The following suggested values for the <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish various kinds of division characteristic of front matter:</p>
                     <list type="gloss">
                        <label>'preface'</label>
                        <item>A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or publisher explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text.</item>
                        <label>'ack'</label>
                        <item>A formal declaration of acknowledgement by the author in which persons and institutions are thanked for their part in the creation of a text.</item>
                        <label>'dedication'</label>
                        <item>A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or institutions by the author.</item>
                        <label>'abstract'</label>
                        <item>A summary of the content of a text as continuous prose.</item>
                        <label>'contents'</label>
                        <item>A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its constituents. The list element should be used to mark its structure.</item>
                        <label>'frontispiece'</label>
                        <item>A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the front matter of a text may be encoded. The front part begins with a title page, which is presented in section <ptr target="#textTitlePages"/>, below. This is followed by a dedication and a preface, each of which is encoded as a distinct div:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample368.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>The front matter concludes with another <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element, shown in the next example, this time containing a table of contents, which contains a <gi scheme="MEI">list</gi> element (as described in chapter <ptr target="#textLists"/>). Note the use of the <gi scheme="MEI">ptr</gi> element to provide page-references: the implication here is that the target identifiers (song1, song2, etc.) will correspond with identifiers used for the <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> elements containing the individual songs. (For a description of the <gi scheme="MEI">ptr</gi> element, see chapter <ptr target="#linkFromMei"/>.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample369.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>

                     </p>
                     <p>Alternatively, the pointers in the table of contents might link to the page breaks at which a song begins, assuming that these have been included in the markup:</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample370.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div xml:id="textBack" type="div4">
                     <head>Back Matter</head>
                     <p>Conventions vary as to which elements are grouped as back matter and which as front. For example, some books place the table of contents at the front, and others at the back. For this reason, the content models of the <gi scheme="MEI">front</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">back</gi> elements are identical.</p>
                     <p>The following suggested values may be used for the <att>type</att> attribute on all division elements, in order to distinguish various kinds of divisions characteristic of back matter:</p>
                     <list type="gloss">
                        <label>'appendix'</label>
                        <item>An ancillary self-contained section of a work, often providing additional but in some sense extra-canonical text.</item>
                        <label>'glossary'</label>
                        <item>A list of terms associated with definition texts (‘glosses’).</item>
                        <label>'notes'</label>
                        <item>A section in which textual notes are gathered together.</item>
                        <label>'bibliography'</label>
                        <item>A list of bibliographic citations.</item>
                        <label>'index'</label>
                        <item>Any form of index to the work.</item>
                        <label>'colophon'</label>
                        <item>A statement appearing at the end of a book describing the conditions of its physical production.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>No additional elements are proposed for the encoding of back matter at present. Some characteristic examples follow; first, an index (for the case in which a printed index is of sufficient interest to merit transcription):</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/text/text-sample372.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note that if the page breaks in the original source have also been explicitly encoded, and given identifiers, the references to them in the above index can more usefully be recorded as links. For example, assuming that the encoding of page 77 of the original source starts like this:</p>

               <head>Text in MEI</head>
               <p>This chapter describes methods for encoding textual content with MEI. Textual information on scores has several different uses, although some text is closer to music notation than other kinds. For example, tempo marks, directives and lyrics are directly related to the functionality of the notated music and are, therefore, described in other chapters (see for example <ptr target="#lyricsDesc"/> and <ptr target="#sharedTextDirectives"/>).</p>
               <p>Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal primarily with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). These elements are provided to encode relatively basic textual information. For deeper encoding of text, these Guidelines recommend consideration of other text-specific encoding formats with embedded MEI markup.</p>
               <div xml:id="sharedParagraphs" type="div3">
                  <head>Paragraphs</head>
                  <p>Paragraphs are fundamental to prose text and typically group one or more sentences that form a logical passage. Usually, it is typographically distinct; that is, it usually begins on a new line and the first letter of the content is often indented, enlarged, or both. This element has a similar meaning as the corresponding elements in Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and HTML.</p>
                  <p>A paragraph is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">p</gi> element:</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="p"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prose text is used for several different purposes within a MEI document, therefore <gi scheme="MEI">p</gi> can occur in many situations. For example, it may be used within metadata elements (see <ptr target="#headerstructure"/>):</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure>
                        <head/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Alternatively, paragraphs may be part of the document contents (and therefore encoded within <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi>), either as <ptr target="#textFrontBack"/> or within the music notation. In these cases, a paragraph will likely be contained by a <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> or other elements containing prose (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi>, etc.).</p>
                  <p>The following example shows a paragraph in a preface section:</p>

                  <p>Sometimes, it is desirable to capture the typographical qualities of a word or phrase without assigning it a special meaning. For this purpose, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">rend</gi> element, similar to TEI’s <hi rend="italic">hi</hi> element. Using CSS-like values, its <att>rend</att> attribute can be used to specify many typographic features, such as font style, font variants, and relative font size and weight. In addition, text decoration, direction, and enclosing ‘boxes’ may be captured. While <att>rend</att> is used to record relative font size and weight, absolute values for these qualities (measured in printer’s points) should be specified using the <att>fontsize</att> and <att>fontweight</att> attributes. In addition to commonly found typographical qualities, MEI provides the <att>altrend</att> attribute for the capture of additional, user-defined rendition information.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">rend</gi> element can accept <att>glyph.auth</att> and <att>glyph.uri</att> attributes, which provide encoders with the ability to specify an external authority for Unicode codepoints in the textual content. Only the text content that should be rendered using SMuFL code points should go inside the <gi scheme="MEI">rend</gi> element when using <att>glyph.auth</att> and <att>glyph.uri</att>.</p>

                     <p>The figure description (<gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi>) element usually contains a brief prose description of the appearance or content of a graphic figure, for use when documenting an image, perhaps without displaying it. This element is intended for use as an alternative to the content of its parent <gi scheme="MEI">fig</gi> element; for example, for display when the equipment in use cannot display graphic images. It may also be used for indexing or documentary purposes, in which case best practice suggests the use of controlled vocabulary terms.</p>

                     <p>Occasionally, a figure description may have a complex structure.

The drawback to TIFF is that it actually is a wrapper for several formats, and some TIFF-supporting software does not support all variants. TIFF files may use LZW, CCITT Group 4, or PackBits compression methods, or may use no compression at all. Also, TIFF files may be monochrome, greyscale, or polychromatic. All such options should be specified in prose at the end of the encodingDesc section of the MEI header for any document including TIFF images. TIFF is owned by Aldus Corporation. Documentation on TIFF is available from the owner at Craigcook Castle, Craigcook Road, Edinburgh EH4 3UH, Scotland, or 411 First Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98104 USA.</item>

                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">list</gi> element can identify any kind of list; the <att>form</att> attribute can be used to specify whether the list is ordered, unordered etc. Each item in the list is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">li</gi> element. The <att>n</att> can be used to record a label for a list item, as in the following example:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Occasionally, lists have headers or titles, which can be encoded with <gi scheme="MEI">head</gi>:</p>

                  <head>Tables</head>
                  <p>The element <gi scheme="MEI">table</gi> contains text displayed in tabular form, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, in rows and columns. A table is the least ‘graphic’ of the elements discussed in this chapter. Almost any text structure can be presented as a series of rows and columns: one might, for example, choose to show a glossary or other form of list in tabular form, without necessarily regarding it as a table. When tabular presentation is regarded as of less intrinsic importance, it is correspondingly simpler to encode descriptive or functional information about the contents of the table, for example to identify one cell as containing a name and another as containing a date, though the two methods may be combined.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">table</gi> element may appear both within other components (such as paragraphs), or between them, provided that the module defined in this chapter has been enabled. It is to a large extent arbitrary whether a table should be regarded as a series of rows or as a series of columns. For compatibility with currently available systems, however, these Guidelines require a row-by-row description of a table.</p>
                  <p>While rows and columns are always encoded in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, formatting properties such as those provided by CSS may be used to specify that they should be displayed differently.</p>

A cell is the intersection of a row and a column. The precise rendition of the table and its cells should be specified in a style steet. <figure>

                  <p>It is common, in many types of texts, to find quotations. A quotation is typically attributed to another text other than the one being encoded. Often, the quoted material is typographically distinct from the surrounding text; <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, surrounded by so-called ‘quote marks’ or rendered as a separate block of text. The <gi scheme="MEI">quote</gi> element is used to mark this function:</p>

                  <p>This <gi scheme="MEI">lg</gi> (line group) element is used generically to encode any section of text that is organized as a group of lines. Following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative, it is recommended to use it, along with the following elements, for marking up poetry:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Because <gi scheme="MEI">lg</gi> groups verses, it can be used to encode additional stanzas not integrated into the music notation. In addition, it is common for a poem to include a title or a header, as is demonstrated by the following example:</p>

                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi> element is intended for generic applications and may be used to identify any named entity, such as a person, item, application, place, etc. Sometimes, however, a more specific encoding is desired, identifying the type of entity by using dedicated elements. MEI offers an (optional) module for this, which provides such elements for various types of names.</p>

                  <p>These elements fall into the following categories: - identification of the bibliographic entity and those responsible for its intellectual content - publication and distribution data for the bibliographic entity - description of the physical characteristics of the item - annotation of the bibliographic citation and additional details regarding the item’s intellectual content</p>
                  <p>The elements <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">edition</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">series</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">identifier</gi> fall into the first category as do the elements <gi scheme="MEI">creator</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">contributor</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">funder</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">sponsor</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi>. The respStmt element is provided for marking responsibility roles that cannot be recorded using more specific elements. The <gi scheme="MEI">biblScope</gi> element also carries information of an identifying nature.</p>
                  <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">identifier</gi> for a given item may be an International Standard Book/Music Number, Library of Congress Control Number, a publisher’s or plate number, a personal identification number, an entry in a bibliography or catalog, etc.</p>
                  <p>To classify the <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> according to some convenient typology, the <att>type</att> attribute may be used. Sample values include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective title). The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for convenience in analysing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element. Title parts may be encoded in <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> sub-elements. The name of the list from which a controlled value is taken may be recorded using the <att>authority</att> attribute.</p>
                  <p>Publication and distribution data may be captured using <gi scheme="MEI">pubPlace</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">publisher</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">distributor</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi> elements directly inside <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> when the citation is unstructured. However, these elements should be grouped within <gi scheme="MEI">imprint</gi> whenever practical.</p>
                  <p>The physical characteristics of the cited item may be described using the <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>Annotation of the bibliographic citation and the provision of other pertinent details are addressed by several elements. Commentary on the bibliographic item or citation is accommodated by the <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">creation</gi> elements. The <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> element is provided for generic comments, while <gi scheme="MEI">creation</gi> is intended to hold information about the context of the creation of the cited item. Terms by which the bibliographic item can be classified may be placed in <gi scheme="MEI">genre</gi>. For letters and other correspondence, <att>role</att>=<val>crp</val>, i.e., correspondent [or recipient] (<gi scheme="MEI">contributor</gi>) captures the name of the person or organization to whom the item was addressed. The natural language(s) of the item may be recorded in one or more <gi scheme="MEI">textLang</gi> elements. Finally, a holding institution may be documented using the <gi scheme="MEI">repository</gi> element directly within <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>, but <gi scheme="MEI">physLoc</gi> should be used whenever possible as a grouping mechanism for location and shelfmark information. To identify sub-units of the holding institution, <gi scheme="MEI">repository</gi> sub-elements may be used. The name of the list from which a controlled value for the agency name is taken may be recorded using the <att>authority</att> attribute.</p>
                  <p>When supplied with a <att>target</att> attribute, <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> may function as a hypertext reference to an external electronic resource. In addition, other related bibliographic items may be described or referenced using the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> element.</p>

                     <p>In some situations it is necessary to provide references from one bibliographic item to another. For these situations, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> element. A <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> may be used inside of <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>, and may either point to a different entity using its <att>target</att> attribute, or may hold the related item as a child.</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure>
                           <head/>
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="code" xml:space="preserve"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../examples/shared/shared-sample013.txt" parse="text"/></egXML>
                        </figure>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this example, the nested <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> / <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> provides information about the ‘container’ where the outer <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> may be found. The kind of relation is expressed using the <att>rel</att> attribute. It describes the relationship of the child <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> to the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>’s parent <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <specList>
                           <specDesc key="relatedItem" atts="rel"/>
                        </specList>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these relations, the subject is always the relatedItem, and the object is always the parent of the relatedItem. Thus, a value of <att>rel</att>="preceding" indicates that the resource described within the relatedItem (or referenced by its <att>target</att> attribute) precedes the <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> containing the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>. Following <abbr>MODS</abbr>, both values of <val>preceding</val> and <val>succeeding</val> indicate a temporal order.</p>
                     <p>It is important not to confuse <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> with the concepts of <ptr target="#FRBR"/>; see <ptr target="#headerRelatedItemVsFRBR"/>.</p>

                  <head>Annotations</head>
                  <p>Annotations are one of the most versatile features of MEI. They are provided using the <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>
                     <specList>
                        <specDesc key="annot"/>
                     </specList>
                  </p>
                  <p>This element may be contained by a wide range of other elements and may contain a large number of other elements. While this offers great flexibility in addressing the wide variety of textual features that might occur within an annotation, it may lead to markup that cannot be effectively processed mechanistically.</p>
                  <p>In all cases, <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> provides a comment upon a feature of the encoding, but never contains textual transcription. Depending on its context, an annotation will deal with either its parent element, or, more usually, with the element(s) specified in its <att>plist</att> attribute. This attribute uses URI references to link to one or more other elements using their <att>xml:id</att> attribute values, as in the following example:</p>
