      <p>I bought my first early music from Harold Reeves in London in the summer of 1928 when
         I was able to acquire virtually all the 18th century editions, particularly of trio
         music, which he then had in stock, going back not only through his current but also
         through earlier catalogues, picking out numbers which remained unsold. It is almost
         a shame today to think of the prices at which such things were then available, one
         or two pounds apiece.
