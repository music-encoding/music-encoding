  <head>Vocal Text</head>
  <p>This chapter describes how to encode words and syllables in vocal notation. This text is
    typically written under a staff to indicate the text to be vocally performed. As such, this text
    should not be confused with other text on the score, for which see <ptr
      target="#sharedTextualElements"/> and <ptr target="#text"/>
  </p>
  <p>These guidelines suggest two methods for encoding text in vocal notation: encoding syllables
      <ref target="#lyricsInEvents">under each note</ref> and encoding performed text <ref
      target="#lyricsAfterEvents">after the notes</ref> (and other staff events) either within <gi
      scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements or within <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> elements when
    available (for example in a Common Music Notation context). Each method may be more convenient
    depending on the source text and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends to
    record.</p>
  <!-- TODO: Check if <syl> belongs here or in the shared chapter (#lyricSyllables). Writing here for now! -->
  <p>Both methods eventually rely on the <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi> element, which is part of the
      <soCalled>shared</soCalled> module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following
    sections will begin by introducing the general use of <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi> and then show in
    detail the two different encoding methods.</p>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="lyricsSyl">
    <head>Lyric Syllables</head>
    <p>By <soCalled>lyric syllable</soCalled>, these guidelines mean a word or portion of a word
      that is to be performed vocally. Each syllable is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi>
      element, with which it is also possible to specify the position of the syllable in a word, the
      type of connectors between syllables, alignment adjustments, and the formatting for each
      syllable. These are the key components:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="syl"/>
        <specDesc key="syl" atts="wordpos con halign"/>
      </specList>
    </p>

    <p>The attribute <att>wordpos</att> is used to specify the position of the marked-up lyric
      syllable in a word. It allows the following values:</p>
    <list type="gloss">
      <label>i</label>
      <item> - Indicates that the current syllable's position is <emph>i</emph>nitial; that is, at
        the beginning of a word;</item>
      <label>m</label>
      <item> - Indicates that the current syllable is in the <emph>m</emph>iddle of a word;</item>
      <label>t</label>
      <item> - Indicates that the syllable's position is <emph>t</emph>erminal; that is, at the end
        of a word.</item>
      <!-- TODO: Need a value to indicate the syllable is the entire word? -->
    </list>

    <p>When a syllable is at the beginning or in the middle of a word (in which case it will have
      the <att>wordpos</att> attribute set to <soCalled>i</soCalled> or <soCalled>m</soCalled>), it
      is recommended to specify the type of connector written between the current and the following
      syllable. This is expressed with the <att>con</att> attribute, which takes the following
      values:</p>
    <list type="gloss">
      <label>s</label>
      <item> - A <emph>s</emph>pace is used as a connector between syllables;</item>
      <label>d</label>
      <item> - A <emph>d</emph>ash is used as a connector between syllables;</item>
      <label>u</label>
      <item> - An <emph>u</emph>nderscore sign (indicating prologation of the syllable) is used as a
        connector between syllables;</item>
      <label>t</label>
      <item> - A <emph>t</emph>ilde is used to indicate elision with the following syllable. This is
        typically rendered as a small curved line between the syllables.</item>
    </list>

    <p>Occasionally, a word or a final syllable needs to be extended across multiple notes. In this
      case an <soCalled>extender</soCalled> is provided. An extender is a continuous line drawn at
      the text's baseline from the end of the syllable associated with the first note until the last
      note to be sung with the syllable.</p>

    <p>The use of <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi> described in this section is common to CMN and other
      notation systems, such as mensural notation. Other uses specific to certain types of notation
      and repertoires are addressed in other chapters. See for example <ptr target="#neumes"/>.</p>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="lyricsInEvents">
    <head>Vocally Performed Text Encoded Within Notes</head>
    <p>Each lyric syllable can be encoded directly within an associated note, either by using the
        <att>syl</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> or the <gi scheme="MEI">verse</gi>
      element.</p>
    <p>Using the <att>syl</att> attribute on notes is the simplest way of encoding vocally performed
      text and is recommended only for simple situations or for those encodings which do not focus
      on vocally performed text.</p>
    <p>The following example from Handel's <title>Messiah</title> (HWV 56) shows the use of
        <att>syl</att>:</p>

    <p>When there are multiple lines of vocally performed text, or the encoder wishes to be more
      specific about connectors, etc., the use of <gi scheme="MEI">verse</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI"
        >syl</gi> is recommended.</p>

    <p>As it is common practice in written text, it is assumed that a space separates words. Many
      vocal texts, however, introduce elisions and connect two syllables into one unit. For example,
      the vocal text from Mozart's <title>Don Giovanni</title> sung by Don Giovanni in Finale II,
        <q>Ho fermo il core in petto</q> introduces an elision between the word <q>fermo</q> and
        <q>il</q> and between <q>core</q> and <q>in</q>. An elision can be indicated by placing both
      syllables within the same <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> and setting the <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi>
      element's <att>con</att> attribute value to 't':</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<note>
  <verse>
    <syl wordpos="t" con="t">re</syl>
    <syl wordpos="i">in</syl>
  </verse>
</note>
    </egXML>

    <p>When there is more than one line of text, more than one <gi scheme="MEI">verse</gi> element
      can be used. The following example from a piano reduction of Wagner's <title>Rheingold</title>
      has two lines of text, with an English translation on the second line. Note the use of the
        <att>xml:lang</att> attribute to differentiate the two languages:</p>

    <p>Optionally, it is possible to include an <gi scheme="MEI">lb</gi> element within <gi
        scheme="MEI">verse</gi> to explicitly encode line and line group endings. This is
      specifically meant to facilitate karaoke applications.</p>

    <p>Finally, the <att>rhythm</att> attribute can be used to specify a rhythm for the syllable
      that differs from that of the notes on the staff.</p>
    <!-- TODO: NEED EXAMPLE HERE -->

  </div>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="lyricsAfterEvents">
    <head>Vocally Performed Text Encoded Separately</head>
    <p>Vocally performed text may also be encoded separately from the notes with the <gi
        scheme="MEI">lyrics</gi> element. These are the main components:</p>

    <p><specList>
        <specDesc key="lyrics"/>
        <specDesc key="lyrics" atts="staff layer"/>
      </specList></p>

    <p>Since this element is separated from the encoding of the notes, it must be associated with a
      staff that will provide rhythm information when required for automated processing. The
        <att>staff</att> attribute gives the associated staff and if there is more than one layer on
      that staff, the <att>layer</att> attribute may be used to indicate the layer from which the
      rhythm should be taken. If there is any divergence between the rhythm of the vocally performed
      text and the notes, the <att>rhythm</att> attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">verse</gi> may be used
      to specify the text's rhythm.</p>

    <p>The following example from Carl Maria von Weber's <title>Der Freischütz</title> illustrates
      this encoding method:</p>
