<!-- Note to editors: I'm avoiding to use the word lyrics because the Grove dictionary associates it exclusively with popular music,
  while MEI caters for a wider repertoire. In the chapter "Vocal Notation", Read refers to "text" and "words", without giving a specific
  name to this text under the notes. I am following this idea and simply referring to text and words or occasionally "vocally performed" text.
  I am happy to re-edit this into "lyrics" if necessary. RV

  <head>Text in Vocal Notation</head>
  <p>This chapter describes how to encode words and syllables in vocal notation. This text is
    typically written under a staff to notate the text to be vocally performed. As such, this text
    should not be confused with other text on the score, for which see <ptr
      target="#textualElements"/> and <ptr target="#"/>
    <!-- TODO: add reference to "Text in MEI" -->
  </p>
  <p>These guidelines suggest two methods for encoding text in vocal notation: encoding syllables
      <ref target="#lyricsInEvents">under each note</ref> and encoding performed text <ref
      target="#lyricsAfterEvents">after the notes</ref> (and other staff events) either within
      <gi>layer</gi> elements or within <gi>measure</gi> elements when available (for example in a
    Common Music Notation context). Each method may be more convenient depending on the source text
    and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends to record.</p>
  <!-- TODO: Check if <syl> belongs here or in the shared chapter (#lyricSyllables). Writing here for now! -->
  <p>Both methods eventually rely on the <gi>syl</gi> element, which is part of the
      <soCalled>shared</soCalled> module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following
    sections will begin by introducing the general use of <gi>syl</gi> and then show in detail the
    two different encoding methods.</p>

  <!-- TODO: This section may not be necessary if <syl> is covered in shared. If helpful, this div coulf be moved there or adapted. -->
  <!-- I think it's fine here. PR -->
  <div type="div2" xml:id="lyricsSyl">
    <head>Lyric Syllables</head>
    <p>By <soCalled>lyric syllable</soCalled>, these guidelines mean the portion of a word that is
      to be performed vocally. Each syllable is encoded with the <gi>syl</gi> element, with which it
      is also possible to specify the position of the syllable in a word, the type of connectors
      between syllables, alignment adjustments, and the formatting for each syllable. These are the
      key components:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="syl" atts="worpos con halign"/>
      </specList>
    </p>

    <p>The attribute <att>wordpos</att> is used to specify the position of the marked-up lyric
      syllable in a word. It allows the following values: <list type="gloss">
        <label>i</label>
        <item>Indicates that the current syllable is <emph>i</emph>nitial, that is at the beginning
          of a word;</item>
        <label>m</label>
        <item>Indicates that the current syllable is in the <emph>m</emph>iddle of a word;</item>
        <label>t</label>
        <item>Indicates that the current syllable is <emph>t</emph>erminal, that is at the end of a
          word.</item>
      </list></p>

    <p>As it is common practice in written text, it is assumed that a space separates different
      words. Whereas, when a syllable is at the beginning or in the middle of a word (in which case
      it will have the <att>wordpos</att> attribute set to <soCalled>i</soCalled> or
        <soCalled>m</soCalled>), it is recommended to specify the type of connector written between
      the current and the following syllable. This is expressed with the <att>con</att> attribute,
      which takes the following values: <list type="gloss">
        <label>s</label>
        <item>A <emph>s</emph>pace is used as connector between syllables;</item>
        <label>d</label>
        <item>A <emph>d</emph>ash is used as connector between syllables;</item>
        <label>u</label>
        <item>An <emph>u</emph>nderscore sign (indicating prologation of the syllable) is used as
          connector between syllables;</item>
        <label>t</label>
        <item>A <emph>t</emph>ilde is used to indicate elision. This is typically rendered as a
          small curved line between the syllables.</item>
      </list>
    </p>

    <p>The definition of <soCalled>word</soCalled> here is flexible. Many languages will introduce
      elisions and connect two words into one unit. The lyric syllables will split the newly formed
      unit as opposed to the grammatical words. For example, the verse from Mozart's <title>Don
        Giovanni</title> sung by Don Giovanni in the Finale II, <q>Ho fermo il core in petto</q>
      introduces an elision between the word <q>fermo</q> and <q>il</q> and between <q>core</q> and
        <q>il</q> resulting in the following encoding:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve"><syl>Ho</syl> 
<!-- other encoding here -->
<syl wordpos="i" con="d">fer</syl> 
<!-- ... -->
<syl wordpos="t">moil</syl>
<!-- ... -->
<syl>corein</syl>
<!-- ... -->
<syl wordpos="i" con="d">pet</syl>
<!-- ... -->
<syl wordpos="t">to</syl></egXML>
    <p>This is a common phenomenon, though it is beyond the scope of these guidelines to discuss it
      further. It is simply recommended to include within one <gi>syl</gi> element any vocally
      performed portion of a word that the encoder believes to belong to a certain event on the
      staff.</p>

    <p>Occasionally, a word or a final syllable needs to be extended across multiple notes. In this
      case an <soCalled>extender</soCalled> is often written as a long continuous line until the
      last note (see <bibl>Read 1979, p. 296</bibl>). Since such extenders can be determined
      programmatically, MEI does not provide a method for encoding extenders.
      <!-- TODO: Or can the attribute @to be used for this? --></p>

    <p>The use of <gi>syl</gi> described in this section is common to CMN and other notation
      systems, such as Mensural notation. Other uses specific to certain types of notation and
      repertoires are addressed in other chapters. See for example <ptr target="neumes1.2"/>.</p>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="lyricsInEvents">
    <head>Vocally Performed Text Encoded Within Notes</head>
    <p>Each lyric syllable can be encoded directly within an associated note, either by using the
        <att>syl</att> attribute on <gi>note</gi> or the <gi>verse</gi> element.</p>
    <p>Using the <att>syl</att> attribute on notes is the simplest way of encoding vocally performed
      text and is recommended only for simple situations or for those encodings which do not focus
      on vocally performed text.</p>
    <p>The following example from Handel's <title>Messiah</title> (HWV 56) shows the use of
        <att>syl</att>:</p>

      The following example from a piano reduction of Wagner's <title>Rheingold</title> has two

    <p>Optionally, it is possible to include an <gi>lb</gi> element within <gi>verse</gi> to
      explicitly encode line and line group endings. This is specifically meant to facilitate
      karaoke applications.</p>

    <p>Finally, the <att>rhythm</att> attribute can be used to specify a rhythm for the syllable
      that differs from that of the notes on the staff.</p>
    <!-- TODO: NEED EXAMPLE HERE -->

  <div type="div2" xml:id="lyricsAfterEvents">
    <head>Vocally performed text encoded separately</head>
    <p>Vocally performed text may also be encoded separately from the notes with the <gi>lyrics</gi>
      element. These are the main components:</p>

    <p><specList>
        <specDesc key="lyrics" atts="staff layer"/>
      </specList></p>

    <p>Since this element is separated from the encoding of the notes, it may be associated with a
      staff that will provide the rhythm in case when it is required during processing. The
        <att>staff</att> attribute gives the associated staff and if there is more than one layer on
      that staff, the <att>layer</att> attribute may be used to indicate the layer from which the
      rhythm should be taken. If there is any divergence between the rhythm of the vocally performed
      text and the notes, the <att>rhythm</att> attribute on <gi>verse</gi> may be used to specify
      the text's rhythm.</p>
