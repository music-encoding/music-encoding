  <head>Performances</head>
  <p>This chapter describes the <soCalled>performance</soCalled> module, which can be used for
    organizing audio and video files of performances of a musical work. The elements provided allow
    the encoder to group different recordings of the same performance, identify temporal segments
    within the recordings, and encode simple alignments with a music text.</p>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="perfElements">
    <head>Overview</head>
    <p>The following elements are available to encode information about a recorded performance:</p>

    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="performance"/>
        <specDesc key="recording"/>
        <specDesc key="avFile"/>
        <specDesc key="clip"/>
        <specDesc key="when"/>
      </specList>
    </p>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">performance</gi> element begins a subtree of the <gi scheme="MEI"
        >music</gi> element and appears alongside with, or instead of, <gi scheme="MEI">body</gi>
      (described in <ptr target="#musicElement"/> and <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> (described in
        <ptr target="#facsimiles"/>). A <gi scheme="MEI">performance</gi> element represents one
      recorded performance event. As a performance may be recorded in multiple formats or by
      different personnel or or using different equipment, the <gi scheme="MEI">performance</gi>
      element may group one or more recordings of the event.</p>

    <p>The <att>decls</att> attribute can be used to point to performance medium metadata for the
      performed work. See <ptr target="#workMedium"/> for more details.</p>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">recording</gi> element identifies a single recording event taking place
      within an absolute temporal space. The class att.mediabounds contains attributes that can be
      used to define this space:</p>

    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="att.mediabounds" atts="begin end betype"/>
      </specList>
    </p>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">avFile</gi> element identifies an external file associated with a
      recording act. In the simplest case, the recording element will contain one <gi scheme="MEI"
        >avFile</gi> element identifying a file that represents it. The <att>target</att> attribute
      contains the URI of the digital media file. Use of the <att>mimetype</att> attribute is
      recommended for the <gi scheme="MEI">avFile</gi> element. Its value should be a valid MIME
      media type defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 2046. It is also recommended
      that all avFile elements have a recording or clip parent which bears the <att>begin</att>,
        <att>end</att>, and <att>betype</att> attributes.</p>

    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:03:10.00" betype="time">
    <avFile target="http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording" mimetype="audio/wav"/>
  </recording>
</performance>
  </egXML>

    <p>Sometimes, multiple digital files are created in order to provide greater flexibility in
      redistribution and playback capabilities. In this case, multiple avFile elements may occur,
      each with a different mimetype. Keep in mind, however, that each file still represents the
      complete temporal extent of the recording act in spite of the change of file format:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:03:10.00" betype="time">
    <avFile target="http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording" mimetype="audio/wav"/>
    <avFile target="http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording" mimetype="audio/mpeg"/>
  </recording>
</performance>
  </egXML>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">clip</gi> element identifies a temporal segment of a recording act. In
      the following example, the clip begins two minutes into the timeframe of the recording and
      ends 20 seconds later:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:03:10.00" betype="time">
  <clip begin="00:02:00.00" end="00:20:20.00" betype="time"/>    
</recording>
  </egXML>

    <p>Beyond these relatively simple uses, complex situations may occur that require equally
      complex markup. For example, a single performance may be represented by multiple digital media
      files. Because they have differing durations, the media files must be the result of separate
      recording acts, even if these recording acts took place at the same time:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:03:10.00" betype="time">
    <avFile target="http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording" mimetype="audio/wav"/>
  </recording>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:03:15.00" betype="time">
    <avFile target="http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording" mimetype="audio/mpeg"/>
  </recording>
</performance>
  </egXML>

    <p>A single performance may also be represented by multiple, <emph>sequential</emph> digital
      files, as when a complete work is recorded in several so-called <soCalled>takes</soCalled>. In
      this case, the files may be considered to be parts of a single recording act, the extent of
      which is the combined extent of the individual clips. For example, a series of <gi
        scheme="MEI">clip</gi> elements may be used to identify each movement of a piece and give
      start and end times for the movements in relation to the overall temporal space of the
      complete work:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording>
    <clip n="mov1" begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:07:00.00" betype="time">
      <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement01.aiff"/>
    </clip>
    <clip n="mov2" begin="00:07:01.00" end="00:12:03.00" betype="time">
      <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement02.aiff"/>
    </clip>
  </recording>
</performance>
  </egXML>

    <p>Similar markup is also applicable when a single file representing the entirety of a recording
      act is broken into segments later, as is often done for practical storage and distribution
      reasons. The file from which the clips are derived is indicated using an avFile element:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording n="completeWork" begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:12:03.00" betype="time">
    <avFile target="completeWork.aiff" mimetype="audio/aiff"/>
    <clip n="mov1" begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:07:00.00" betype="time">
      <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement01.aiff"/>
    </clip>
    <clip n="mov2" begin="00:07:02.00" end="00:12:03.00" betype="time">
      <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement02.aiff"/>
    </clip>
  </recording>
</performance>
  </egXML>

    <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">clip</gi> may be used to define any region of interest, such as a cadenza
      or a modulation, a song verse, etc. The following example shows the use of <gi scheme="MEI"
        >clip</gi> and its attributes to identify significant sections of a recording:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:05:21.00" betype="time">
    <!-- Exposition -->
    <clip begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:01:41.00" betype="time"/>
    <!-- Development -->
    <clip begin="00:01:41.00" end="00:03:14.00" betype="time"/>
    <!-- Recapitulation -->
    <clip begin="00:03:14.00" end="00:04:28.00" betype="time"/>
    <!-- Coda -->
    <clip begin="00:04:28.00" end="00:05:21.00" betype="time"/>
  </recording>
</performance>
  </egXML>

    <p>The preceding example also demonstrates that media files are not required in order to define
      the temporal space of a recording act or clip. This makes it possible to set the boundaries of
      these features, then use the content of the performance element as a rudimentary "edit
      decision list" to create the matching digital files.</p>

    <p>If an encoding of the notated text with which the media files are associated is included in
      the MEI file, the <att>startid</att> attribute can be used to indicate the first element in
      the sequence of events to which the recording corresponds:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<performance>
  <recording n="mov1" begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:07:00.00" betype="time" startid="#performance.m1_1">
    <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="fullpiece.aiff"/>
  </recording>
</performance>
<!-- ... -->
<body>
  <mdiv>
    <score>
      <section>
        <measure n="1" xml:id="performance.m1_1">
          <!-- ... -->
        </measure>
      </section>
    </score>
  </mdiv>
</body>
  </egXML>

    <p>Clips can also be aligned with components of the musical text encoded in the <gi scheme="MEI"
        >body</gi>. The <att>startid</att> attribute can be used to specify the starting element in
      the sequence of events to which the clip corresponds. The following example shows the use of
      of clip elements to identify the exposition of the first movement from Beethoven's piano
      sonata Op. 14, no. 2 and its concluding <soCalled>codetta</soCalled>.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<performance>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:05:21.00" betype="time">
    <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="BeethovenOp14N2-Mov1.aiff"/>
    <!-- Exposition -->
    <clip begin="00:00:0.00" end="00:01:41.00" betype="time" startid="#performance.m1"/>
    <!-- Exposition's "codetta" -->
    <clip begin="00:01:31.00" end="00:01:41.00" betype="time" startid="#performance.m48"/>
  </recording>
</performance>
<!-- ... -->
<body>
  <mdiv>
    <score>
      <section>
        <measure n="1" xml:id="performance.m1">
          <!-- ... -->
        </measure>
        <!-- ... -->
        <measure n="48" xml:id="performance.m48">
          <!-- ... -->
        </measure>
      </section>
    </score>
  </mdiv>
</body>
  </egXML>

    <p>Please note that the begin and end times of clips may overlap. In the preceding example, the
      extent of the codetta is contained within that of the exposition. Overlapping beginning and
      ending points may also be used to provide additional performance context for a segment or
      because there is uncertainty with regard to precise values for these points.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<performance>
  <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:03:06.54" betype="time">
    <!-- a section of interest -->
    <clip begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:00:41.00" betype="time"/>
    <!-- the following section starts a little before the end of the 
         previous one to give some "adjustment" time -->
    <clip begin="00:00:31.00" end="00:01:07.00" betype="time"/>
    <!-- the boundaries of the following section are "fuzzy" -->
