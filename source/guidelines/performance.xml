  <head>Performances</head>
  <p>This chapter describes the <soCalled>performance</soCalled> module, which can be used for
    organizing audio and video files of performances of a musical work. The elements provided allow
    the encoder to group different recordings of the same performance, identify temporal segments
    within the recordings and encode simple alignments with a music text.</p>

  <p>The following elements are available to encode performances:</p>

  <p>
    <specList>
      <specDesc key="performance"/>
      <specDesc key="recording"/>
      <specDesc key="avFile"/>
      <specDesc key="clip"/>
    </specList>
  </p>

  <p>The <gi>performance</gi> element begins a subtree of the <gi>music</gi> element and appears
    alongside with, or instead of, <gi>body</gi> (described in <ptr target="#musicElement"/> and
      <gi>facsimile</gi> (described in <ptr target="#facsimile"/>). A <gi>performance</gi> element
    represents one performance of a work; each performance, therefore, should be represented by a
    different <gi>performance</gi> element. As a performance may be recorded in multiple formats or
    by different personnel or equipment, the <gi>performance</gi> element may group one or more
    recordings of the event.</p>

  <p>The <att>decls</att> attribute can be used to point to performance medium metadata for the
    performed work. See <ptr target="#workMedium"/> for more details.</p>

  <p>The <gi>recording</gi> element identifies an audio recording of a performance or a temporal
    segment of the performance. In the simplest case, a recording will contain one <gi>avFile</gi>
    element identifying an audio or video file:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <performance>
      <recording>
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="concert.aiff"/>
      </recording>
    </performance>
    <performance>
      <recording>
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement1.aiff"/>
      </recording>
      <recording>
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement2.aiff"/>
      </recording>
    </performance>
  </egXML>
  <p>Use of the <att>mimetype</att> attribute is recommended for the avFile element. The value
    should be a valid MIME media type defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC
    2046.</p>

  <p>The <gi>recording</gi> element identifies an absolute temporal space in an audio or video file.
    The class <classRef key="att.mediabounds"/> contains the attributes that can be used to define
    this space:</p>

  <p>
    <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.mediabounds" atts="begin end betype"/>
    </specList>
  </p>

  <p>Consider, for example, a complete work recorded as multiple digital files. A series of
      <gi>recording</gi> elements may be used to identify each movement in the piece and give start
    and end times for the movements in relation to the temporal space of the complete work. In this
    case, the <att>begin</att> attribute's value must be equal to or greater than the value of the
      <att>end</att> attribute of the preceding recording.</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <performance>
      <recording n="mov1" begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:07:00.00" betype="time">
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement01.aiff"/>
      </recording>
      <recording n="mov2" begin="00:07:00.00" end="00:12:03.00" betype="time">
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="movement02.aiff"/>
      </recording>
    </performance>
  </egXML>

  <p>If an encoding of the musical text is included in the MEI file, it is possible to use the
      <att>startid</att> attribute to indicate the first element in the sequence of events to which
    the recording corresponds:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <performance>
      <recording n="mov1" begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:07:00.00" betype="time"
        startid="performance.m1_1">
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="fullpiece.aiff"/>
      </recording>
    </performance>
    <!-- ... -->
    <music>
      <!-- ... -->
      <measure n="1" xml:id="performance.m1_1">
        <!-- ... -->
      </measure>
    </music>
  </egXML>

  <p>A <gi>recording</gi> element can also contain one or more <gi>clip</gi> elements, each of which
    represents a temporal region within the space identified by its parent <gi>recording</gi>. A
      <gi>clip</gi> may be used to define any region of interest, such as a cadenza or a modulation,
    a sung verse, etc. The following example shows the use of <gi>clip</gi> and the attributes from
      <classRef key="att.mediabounds"/> to identify significant sections of the recording:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <performance>
      <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:05:21.00" betype="time">
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="ABeethovenPianoSonata-Mov1.aiff"/>
        <!-- Exposition -->
        <clip begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:01:41.00" betype="time"/>
        <!-- Development -->
        <clip begin="00:01:41.00" end="00:03:14.00" betype="time"/>
        <!-- Recapitulation -->
        <clip begin="00:03:14.00" end="00:04:28.00" betype="time"/>
        <!-- Coda -->
        <clip begin="00:04:28.00" end="00:05:21.00" betype="time"/>
      </recording>
    </performance>
  </egXML>

  <p>Like recordings, clips can also be aligned with components of the musical text encoded in the
      <gi>body</gi>. The <att>startid</att> attribute can be used to specify the starting element in
    the sequence of events to which the clip corresponds. The following example shows the encoding
    of a clip identifying the exposition of the first movement from Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 14
    N. 2 and its concluding <soCalled>codetta</soCalled>:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <performance>
      <recording begin="00:00:00.00" end="00:05:21.00" betype="time">
        <avFile mimetype="audio/aiff" target="BeethovenOp14N2-Mov1.aiff"/>
        <!-- Exposition -->
        <clip begin="00:00:0.00" end="00:01:41.00" betype="time" startid="#performance.m1"/>
        <!-- Exposition's "codetta" -->
        <clip begin="00:01:31.00" end="00:01:41.00" betype="time" startid="#performance.m48"/>
      </recording>
    </performance>
    <!-- ... -->
    <music>
      <measure n="1" xml:id="performance.m1">
        <!-- ... -->
      </measure>
      <!-- ... -->
      <measure n="48" xml:id="performance.m48">
        <!-- ... -->
      </measure>
    </music>
  </egXML>
