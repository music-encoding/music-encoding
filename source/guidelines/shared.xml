      <p>The following elements are available for the representation of the outermost structure of
        an MEI document:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="mei"/>

      <p>A typical MEI document contains an <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> element, which in turn
        contains metadata, represented by an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element, and the musical
        text itself, represented by a <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi> element. The <gi scheme="MEI"
          >meiHead</gi> element, formally declared in the MEI.header module, is described in chapter
          <ptr target="#header"/>.</p>
      <p>Other variations on this basic form are also available for the representation of a:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>collection of related MEI-encoded texts, each with its own metadata, known as a
          corpus</item>
        <item>document that contain only metadata, known as an independent or stand-alone
          header</item>
        <item>music notation markup without metadata, typically intended to be embedded within
          another kind of markup, such as TEI</item>
      </list>
      <p>Further information regarding the organization and encoding of music corpora is given in
        chapter <ptr target="#corpus"/>. Stand-alone headers are more fully described in chapter
          <ptr target="#headerIndependentHeader"/>.</p>

      <p>MEI texts may be regarded either as unitary; that is, forming an organic whole, or as
        composite; that is, consisting of several components which are in some important sense
        independent of each other. The distinction is not always entirely obvious. For example, a
        collection of songs might be regarded as a single item in some circumstances, or as a number
        of distinct items in others. In such borderline cases, the encoder must choose whether to
        treat the text as unitary or composite; each option may have advantages and
        disadvantages.</p>
      <p>Whether unitary or composite, the musical text is marked with the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >music</gi> tag and may contain front matter, a body, and back matter. In unitary texts,
        the body is tagged using the <gi scheme="MEI">body</gi> element; in composite texts,
        however, where the textual body consists of a series of subordinate musical texts or other
        groups, it is tagged with the <gi scheme="MEI">group</gi> element. The overall structure of
        any musical text, unitary or composite, is thus defined by the following elements:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="front"/>
          <specDesc key="body"/>
          <specDesc key="group"/>
          <specDesc key="back"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Critical editions and collections of works often contain extensive text, such as a title
        page, table of contents, an introductory essay, commentary, biographical sketch, index, etc.
        These textual items may appear in either the front or back elements. The front and back
        elements, available only when the MEI.text module is activated, are described more fully in
        chapter <ptr target="#text"/>.</p>
      <p>The overall structure of a single musical text is:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<mei>
  <meiHead>
    <!-- metadata goes here -->
  </meiHead>
  <music>
    <front>
      <!-- front matter of text, if any, goes here -->

    <back>
      <!-- back matter of text, if any, goes here -->
    </back>
  </music>
</mei>
      </egXML>
      <p>The top-level structure of a composite musical text made up of two unitary musical texts
        is:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<mei>
  <meiHead>

        <head>Grouped Texts</head>
        <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">group</gi> element may be used to represent a collection of
          independent musical texts which is to be regarded as a single unit for processing or other
          purposes. It is provided to simplify the encoding of collections, anthologies, and cyclic
          works. It can also be used to record the potentially complex internal structure of
          corpora, covered more fully in chapter <ptr target="#corpus"/>.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="group"/>

        </p>
        <p>Examples of composite texts which may be represented using the <gi scheme="MEI"
            >group</gi> element include anthologies and other collections. The presence of common
          front matter referring to the whole collection, possibly in addition to front matter
          relating to each individual musical text, is a good indication that a given musical text
          might usefully be encoded in this way.</p>
        <p>For example, the overall structure of a collection of songs might be encoded as
          follows:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<music>
  <group>
    <music><!-- song 1 --></music>
    <music><!-- song 2 --></music>
    <!-- additional songs here -->
  </group>
</music>
        </egXML>
        <p>A group of musical texts may contain other unitary and grouped texts:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<music>
  <group>
    <music><!-- song 1 --></music>
    <group>
      <!-- songs sharing one or more characteristics, treated as a group -->
      <music><!-- song 2 --></music>
      <music><!-- song 3 --></music>
    </group>
  </group>
</music>
        </egXML>
        <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">group</gi> element may be used to encode any kind of collection in
          which the constituents are regarded by the encoder as works in their own right, such as
            <foreign>ad hoc</foreign> single- or multiple-composer collections or anthologies of
          works not originally conceived of as a single composition.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="div4" xml:id="sharedDivisionsBody">
        <head>Divisions of the Body</head>
        <p>This section describes sub-division of the body of a musical text. Front and back matter
          are described in chapter <ptr target="#text"/>.</p>
        <p>The body of a unitary musical text may contain one or more discrete, linear segments. The
          names commonly used for these structural subdivisions vary with the genre, style, and time
          period of the music, or even at the whim of the author, editor, or publisher. For example,
          a major subdivision of a symphony is generally referred to as a ‘movement’. An opera, on
          the other hand, is usually organized into ‘acts’ and then further by ‘scenes’. All such
          divisions are treated as occurrences of the same neutrally-named element, with a
            <att>type</att> attribute used to categorize them independently of their hierarchic
          level.</p>
        <p>The following element is used to identify musical subdivisions. As a member of the class
          att.typed, the <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> element has attributes which can be used to
          classify it according to a two-tier hierarchy.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="mdiv"/>
            <specDesc key="mdiv" atts="type subtype"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>To accommodate "divisions within divisions", an <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> element may
          contain additional <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> sub-elements nested to any level required.
          For example, the encoding of a multi-movement work, such as a symphony, frequently have
          the following structure:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<body xmlns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei">
  <mdiv type="symphony">
    <mdiv type="movement" n="1">
      <!-- contents of mvt 1 -->
    </mdiv>
    <mdiv type="movement" n="2">
      <!-- contents of mvt 2 -->
    </mdiv>
    <mdiv type="movement" n="3">
      <!-- contents of mvt 3 -->
    </mdiv>
    <mdiv type="movement" n="4">
      <!-- contents of mvt 4 -->
    </mdiv>
  </mdiv>
</body>
        </egXML>
        <p>while dramatic works, such as Verdi's opera, <title>Il Trovatore</title>, often exhibit a
          more deeply-nested structure:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<body>
  <mdiv type="opera">
    <mdiv type="act" n="I">
      <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act I, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act I, sc. 2--></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act I, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
    </mdiv>
    <mdiv type="act" n="II">
      <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 2 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="4"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 4 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="5"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 5 --></mdiv>
    </mdiv>
    <mdiv type="act" n="III">
      <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act III, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act III, sc. 2 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act III, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
    </mdiv>
    <mdiv type="act" n="IV">
      <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act IV, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act IV, sc. 2 --></mdiv>
      <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act IV, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
    </mdiv>
  </mdiv>
</body>
        </egXML>
        <p>Conventionally, in performance the musical structures represented by <gi scheme="MEI"
            >mdiv</gi> elements are separated by pauses; however, <foreign>attacca</foreign>,
            <foreign>attacca subito</foreign>, <foreign>seque</foreign>, or similar terms are
          sometimes used at the end of an <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> to indicate that the next <gi
            scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> should begin immediately after the conclusion of the current one.
          These terms have no effect, however, on the logical segmentation of musical content using
            <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> elements.
          <!-- TODO: Do we need a processable way to encode attaca? -->
        </p>
      </div>
      <div type="div4" xml:id="sharedMdivContent">
        <head>Content of Musical Divisions</head>
        <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> element may contain one or both of two possible views:
          score and parts.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="score"/>
            <specDesc key="parts"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> element represents notation in which all the parts of an
          ensemble are arranged on vertically aligned staves, while the <gi scheme="MEI">parts</gi>
          element collects the individually notated parts for each performer or group of performers.
          The explicit encoding of these two <soCalled>views</soCalled> is necessary because it is
          not always possible or desirable to automatically derive one view from the other. In
          addition, separating scores and parts can eliminate a great deal of markup complexity.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<body>
  <mdiv type="movement" n="1">
    <score>
      <!-- markup of score goes here -->
    </score>
    <parts>
      <!-- markup of performers’ parts goes here -->
    </parts>
  </mdiv>
  <!-- additional movements go here -->
</body>
        </egXML>
        <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">parts</gi> elements may also be
          employed to accommodate different methods of organizing the markup – with no particular
          presentation implied. In this case, software may render a collection of parts as a score
          or a score as a collection of parts.</p>
        <p>Within the collective <gi scheme="MEI">parts</gi> element, notation for a single
          performer is represented by the <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> element:</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="part"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> is effectively a small-scale score, allowing all the
          encoding features of a full score, such as multiple staves, performance directives, and so
          on. A group of <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> element is useful for encoding performing parts
          when there is no score, such as in early music part books; when the parts have
          non-aligning bar lines; when different layout features, such as page turns, are needed for
          the score and parts; or for accommodating software that requires part-by-part
          encoding.</p>
        <p>Please note that <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> elements in MEI are not an indication of
          voice leading or staff grouping. Voice leading can be encoded using the <att>next</att>
          attribute, available on all the members of the <ident type="class">model.eventLike</ident>
          class. The <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> element handles grouping of staves in the score
          context.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<parts>
  <part label="Violin 1">
    <!-- first performer’s part -->
  </part>
  <part label="Violin 2">
    <!-- second performer’s part -->
  </part>
  <!-- additional performers’ parts -->
</parts>
        </egXML>
        <p>In both score and part views, the <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> element is used to
          describe logical characteristics of the encoded music, such as key signature, the sounding
          key (as opposed to the notated key signature), meter, etc., and visual features, such as
          page size, staff groupings and display labels, etc. The <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi>
          elements within <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> and the order of <gi scheme="MEI"
            >staffDef</gi> elements inside <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> should follow the score
          order of the source for the encoding.</p>
        <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> may be further divided into
          linear segments called "sections".</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="section"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p><gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements are often used as a scoping mechanism for clef
          signs, key and meter signatures, as well as metronome, tempo, and expression markings.
          Using <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements can help to minimize the need for backward
          scanning to establish context when the starting point for access is not at the beginning
          of the score. <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements may also be used for other
          user-defined, i.e., analytical or editorial, purposes and may therefore be arbitrarily
          nested to any desired level.</p>
        <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi> element shares the same model as the <gi scheme="MEI"
            >section</gi> element. Unlike <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi>, however, it may not be
          recursively nested.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="ending"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>The most common (non-analytical, non-editorial) use of <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> and
            <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi> elements is illustrated below:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<music>
  <body>
    <mdiv>
      <score>
        <section>
          <!-- section one to be repeated -->
        </section>
        <ending n="1">
          <!-- 1st ending -->
        </ending>
        <ending n="2">
          <!-- 2nd ending -->
        </ending>
        <section>
          <!-- next section -->
        </section>
      </score>
    </mdiv>
  </body>
</music>
        </egXML>
        <p>Within <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements, several methods of organization are
          possible, depending upon the notational style of the source material and the encoder's
          needs. For example, when the MEI.cmn module is used, the default organization is
          measure-by-measure, with <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>
          sub-elements within each <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>. Further discussion of CMN notation
          is continued in chapter <ptr target="#cmn"/>.</p>
        <p>However, staff-by-staff organization is more appropriate for music without measures and
          is provided when either the MEI.mensural or MEI.neumes module is employed. Coverage of
          mensural notation is provided in chapter <ptr target="#mensural"/>, while <ptr
            target="#neumes"/> describes neumatic notation.</p>
        <p>It must be noted that, when both the MEI.cmn and MEI.mensural modules are available, it
          is possible to encode CMN notation without using <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> elements;
          that is, staff-by-staff organization may be used and the ends of measures marked using <gi
            scheme="MEI">barLine</gi> elements.</p>
        <!-- TODO:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
          <!-\- NEED EXAMPLE HERE! -\->
        </egXML>-->
        <p>In certain circumstances, this approach may be preferable for reproduction of the visual
          layout of the music. However, the simultaneous use of the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>
          and <gi scheme="MEI">barLine</gi> elements may lead to confusion and should be
          avoided.</p>
        <p>Typically, MEI follows the order of sections as they appear in the document being
          encoded. When performance requires a different order, for instance in the case of D.C. and
          D.S. directives, the following element may be used to define the performance order.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="expansion"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>In the following example, <gi scheme="MEI">expansion</gi> is used to indicate how the
          notated sections should be ordered in a "through-composed" rendition, for example for
          machine performance or analysis. The plist attribute contains an ordered list of
          identifiers of descendant <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi>, <gi
            scheme="MEI">lem</gi>, or <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> elements. The sequence of values in
          the plist attribute indicates that the section labelled 'A' comes first, then the section
          labelled 'B', followed by the 'A' section again. This mechanism must be specified
          independently of any textual directives, such as "Da capo" or "D.S. al Fine", that may be
          present in the document.</p>

      <p>Annotations are one of the most versatile features of MEI. They are provided using the <gi
          scheme="MEI">annot</gi> element.</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="annot"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>This element may be contained by a wide range of other elements and may contain a large
        number of other elements. While this offers great flexibility in addressing the wide variety
        of textual features that might occur within an annotation, it may lead to markup that cannot
        be effectively processed mechanistically.</p>
      <p>In all cases, <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> provides a comment upon a feature of the
        encoding, but never contains textual transcription. Depending on its context, an annotation
        will deal with either its parent element, or, more usually, with the element(s) specified in
        its <att>plist</att> attribute. This attribute uses URI references to link to one or more
        other elements using their <att>xml:id</att> attribute values, as in the following
        example:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<note xml:id="shared.someInterestingNote"/>
<!-- elsewhere in the document: -->
<annot plist="#shared.someInterestingNote">

        <specList>
          <specDesc key="bibl"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> element may contain a mix of text and more specific
        elements, including the following:</p>

      <p>These elements fall into the following categories: <list type="bulleted">

            intellectual content</item>
          <item>publication and distribution data for the bibliographic entity</item>
          <item>description of the physical characteristics of the item</item>
          <item>annotation of the bibliographic citation and additional details regarding the item's
            intellectual content</item>
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>The elements <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">edition</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI"
          >series</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">identifier</gi> fall into the first category as do the
        elements <gi scheme="MEI">arranger</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">author</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI"
          >composer</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">librettist</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">lyricist</gi>, <gi
          scheme="MEI">funder</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">sponsor</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI"
          >respStmt</gi>. The respStmt element is provided for marking responsibility roles that
        cannot be recorded using more specific elements. The <gi scheme="MEI">biblScope</gi> element
        also carries information of an identifying nature.</p>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">identifier</gi> for a given item may be an International Standard
        Book/Music Number, Library of Congress Control Number, a publisher's or plate number, a
        personal identification number, an entry in a bibliography or catalog, etc.</p>
      <p>To classify the <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> according to some convenient typology, the
          <att>type</att> attribute may be used. Sample values include: main (main title),
        subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative
        (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title),
        uniform (collective title). The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for convenience in
        analysing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized
        processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title,
        including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single <gi
          scheme="MEI">title</gi> element. Title parts may be encoded in <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi>
        sub-elements. The name of the list from which a controlled value is taken may be recorded
        using the <att>authority</att> attribute.</p>
      <p>Publication and distribution data may be captured using <gi scheme="MEI">pubPlace</gi>, <gi
          scheme="MEI">publisher</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">distributor</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI"
          >date</gi> elements directly inside <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> when the citation is
        unstructured. However, these elements should be grouped within <gi scheme="MEI">imprint</gi>
        whenever practical.</p>
      <p>The physical characteristics of the cited item may be described using the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >extent</gi> element.</p>
      <p>Annotation of the bibliographic citation and the provision of other pertinent details are
        addressed by several elements. Commentary on the bibliographic item or citation is
        accommodated by the <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">creation</gi> elements.
        The <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> element is provided for generic comments, while <gi
          scheme="MEI">creation</gi> is intended to hold information about the context of the
        creation of the cited item. Terms by which the bibliographic item can be classified may be
        placed in <gi scheme="MEI">genre</gi>. For letters and other correspondence, <gi
          scheme="MEI">recipient</gi> captures the name of the person or organization to whom the
        item was addressed. The natural language(s) of the item may be recorded in one or more <gi
          scheme="MEI">textLang</gi> elements. Finally, a holding institution may be documented
        using the <gi scheme="MEI">repository</gi> element directly within <gi scheme="MEI"
          >bibl</gi>, but <gi scheme="MEI">physLoc</gi> should be used whenever possible as a
        grouping mechanism for location and shelfmark information. To identify sub-units of the
        holding institution, <gi scheme="MEI">repository</gi> sub-elements may be used. The name of
        the list from which a controlled value for the agency name is taken may be recorded using
        the <att>authority</att> attribute.</p>
      <p>When supplied with a <att>target</att> attribute, <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> may function
        as a hypertext reference to an external electronic resource. In addition, other related
        bibliographic items may be described or referenced using the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >relatedItem</gi> element.</p>

      <p>In some situations it is necessary to provide references from one bibliographic item to
        another. For these situations, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> element. A
          <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> may be used inside of <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>, and
        may either point to a different entity using its <att>target</att> attribute, or may hold
        the related item as a child.</p>

 </bibl>
</egXML>
      <p>In this example, the nested <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> / <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>
        provides information about the <soCalled>container</soCalled> where the outer <gi
          scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> may be found. The kind of relation is expressed using the
          <att>rel</att> attribute. It describes the relationship of the child <gi scheme="MEI"
          >bibl</gi> to the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>'s parent <gi scheme="MEI"
        >bibl</gi>.</p>

        <specList>
          <specDesc key="relatedItem" atts="rel"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>In these relations, the subject is always the relatedItem, and the object is always the
        parent of the relatedItem. Thus, a value of <att>rel</att>="preceding" indicates that the
        resource described within the relatedItem (or referenced by its <att>target</att> attribute)
        precedes the <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> containing the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>.
        Following MODS, both values of "preceding" and "succeeding" indicate a temporal order.</p>
      <p>It is important not to confuse <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> with the concepts of <ref
          target="#FRBR">FRBR</ref>; see <ptr target="#headerRelatedItemVsFRBR"/>.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="sharedCommonAttributes">
    <head>Common Attributes</head>
    <p>The following attributes, provided by the <ident type="class">att.common</ident> attribute
      class, are available on nearly all elements in an MEI encoding. They provide the means to
      identify, label, and access elements in MEI-encoded files.</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="att.common" atts="xml:id label n xml:base"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>The value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute serves as an identifier for an element and its
      content. Its value must be unique in the context of the current document and must conform to
      the definition of an XML Name provided by the W3C Recommendation at <ref
        target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name">http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name</ref>.
      Suggestions for constructing an ID value can be found at <ref
        target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-suggested-names"
        >http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-suggested-names</ref>.</p>
    <p>The <att>xml:id</att> attribute may take values similar to the following:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<!-- The following are all valid IDs. -->
<note xml:id="n1"/>
<note xml:id="_n1"/>
<note xml:id="thisIsMyFavoriteNote"/>
<note xml:id="shared.thisIsMyFavoriteNote"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>This is an example of an incorrectly-formulated <att>xml:id</att> value:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<!-- xml:id not valid as IDs are not allowed to start with a number. -->
<note xml:id="1"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>The <att>label</att> and <att>n</att> attributes both serve a labeling function; however,
      they differ in the values they allow. The <att>n</att> attribute must be a single token, while
        <att>label</att> may contain a string value that includes spaces. This makes
        <att>label</att> useful for the capture of free-text labels, but a name or number specified
      with <att>n</att> may be easier to process.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<!-- Example of a @label containing whitespace: -->
<mdiv label="Allegro moderato"> … </mdiv>
<!-- Example of a processable @n attribute: -->
<measure n="42">
  <!--…-->
</measure>
    </egXML>
    <p>When a reference to an external entity is not a complete URI, the <att>xml:base</att>
      attribute can record a value against which it can be resolved into a complete, or absolute,
      location.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<graphic target="myImage.jpg" xml:base="http://www.mySite.org/images/"/>
    </egXML>
    <p>The value of <att>xml:base</att> can be inherited from an ancestor. In the following example,
      the values of the graphic elements' <att>target</att> attribute can be completed by the
      xml:base value specified for the <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> element:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<facsimile xml:base="http://www.mySite.org/images/">
  <surface>
    <graphic target="myImage.jpg"/>
    <graphic target="myImage.tif"/>
  </surface>
</facsimile>
    </egXML>

      details on xml:base.</p>
