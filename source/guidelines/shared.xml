  <head>Shared Elements, Model Classes, and Attribute Classes</head>
  <p>This chapter describes the elements, model classes, and attribute classes that are part of the
    MEI.shared module. The shared module contains declarations that are shared among two or more
    other modules.</p>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="commonAttributes">
    <head>Common Attributes</head>
    <p>The following attributes are common to nearly all elements in an MEI encodiing. They provide
      the means to identify, label, and access elements in MEI-encoded files.</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="att.common" atts="xml:id label n xml:base"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>The value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute serves as an identifier for an element and its
      content. Its value must be unique in the context of the current document and must conform to
      the definition of an XML Name provided by the W3C Recommendation at <ref
        target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name">http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name</ref>.
      Suggestions for constructing an ID value can be found at <ref
        target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-suggested-names"
        >http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-suggested-names</ref>. Examples of xml:id values:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <!-- The following are valid IDs. -->
      <note xml:id="n1"/>
      <note xml:id="_n1"/>
      <note xml:id="thisIsMyFavoriteNote"/>
      <!-- The next one is not valid as IDs are not allowed to start with a number. -->
      <note xml:id="1"/>
    </egXML>
    <p>The <att>label</att> and <att>n</att> attributes both serve a labeling function; however,
      they differ in the values that are permitted. The <att>n</att> attribute may only contain a
      single token, while <att>label</att> may consist of a string value that includes spaces.</p>
    <p>When a reference to an external entity is not a complete URI, the <att>xml:base</att>
      attribute can record a value against which it can be resolved into a complete, or absolute,
      location.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <graphic target="myImage.jpg" xml:base="http://www.mySite.org/images/"/>
    </egXML>
    <p>The value of <att>xml:base</att> can be inherited from an ancestor. In the following example,
      the values of the graphic elements' <att>target</att> attribute can be completed by the
      xml:base value specified for the <gi>facsimile</gi> element:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <facsimile xml:base="http://www.mySite.org/images/">
        <surface>
          <graphic target="myImage.jpg"/>
          <graphic target="myImage.tif"/>
        </surface>
      </facsimile>
    </egXML>
    <p>See <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/</ref> for more
      details on xml:base.</p>

    <div type="div3" xml:id="documentElements">
      <head>Document Elements</head>
      <p>The following elements are available for the representation of the outermost structure of
        an MEI document:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="mei" atts="meiversion"/>
          <specDesc key="meiCorpus"/>
          <specDesc key="meiHead"/>
          <specDesc key="music"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>A typical MEI document contains an <gi>mei</gi> element, which in turn contains metadata,
        represented by an <gi>meiHead</gi> element, and the musical text itself, represented by a
          <gi>music</gi> element. The <gi>meiHead</gi> element, formally declared in the MEI.header
        module, is described in chapter <ptr target="#header"/>. </p>
      <p>Other variations on this basic form are also available for the representation of a:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>collection of related MEI-encoded texts, each with its own metadata, known as a
          corpus</item>
        <item>document that contain only metadata, known as an independent or stand-alone
          header</item>
        <item>music markup without metadata, typically intended to be embedded within another kind
          of markup, such as TEI</item>
      </list>
      <p>Further information regarding the organization and encoding of music corpora is given in
        chapter <ptr target="#corpus"/>. Stand-alone headers are more fully described in chapter
          <ptr target="#independentHeader"/>.

    <div type="div3" xml:id="musicElement">
      <head>Music Element</head>
      <p>The remainder of this chapter describes the <gi>music</gi> element and its high-level
        constituents.</p>
      <p>MEI texts may be regarded either as unitary, that is, forming an organic whole, or as
        composite, that is, consisting of several components which are in some important sense
        independent of each other. The distinction is not always entirely obvious. For example, a
        collection of songs might be regarded as a single item in some circumstances, or as a number
        of distinct items in others. In such borderline cases, the encoder must choose whether to
        treat the text as unitary or composite; each option may have advantages and
        disadvantages.</p>
      <p>Whether unitary or composite, the musical text is marked with the <gi>music</gi> tag and
        may contain front matter, a body, and back matter. In unitary texts, the body is tagged
        using the <gi>body</gi> element; in composite texts, however, where the textual body
        consists of a series of subordinate musical texts or other groups, it is tagged with the
          <gi>group</gi> element. The overall structure of any musical text, unitary or composite,
        is thus defined by the following elements: </p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="front"/>
          <specDesc key="body"/>
          <specDesc key="group"/>
          <specDesc key="back"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Critical editions and collections of works often contain extensive text, such as a title
        page, table of contents, an introductory essay, commentary, biographical sketch, index, etc.
        These textual items may appear in either the front or back elements. The front and back
        elements, available only when the MEI.text module is activated, are described more fully in
        chapter <ptr target="#text"/>.</p>
      <p>The overall structure of a single musical text is:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <mei>
          <meiHead>
            <!-- metada goes here -->
          </meiHead>
          <music>
            <front>
              <!-- front matter of text, if any, goes here -->
            </front>
            <body>
              <!-- body of text goes here -->
            </body>
            <back>
              <!-- back matter of text, if any, goes here -->
            </back>
          </music>
        </mei>
      </egXML>
      <p>The top-level structure of a composite musical text made up of two unitary musical texts
        is: </p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <mei>
          <meiHead>
            <!-- metadata for the composite musical text  -->
          </meiHead>
          <music>
            <front>
              <!-- front matter for composite musical text -->
            </front>
            <group>
              <music>

                  <!-- front matter of first unitary musical text, if any -->
                </front>
                <body>
                  <!-- body of first unitary musical text -->

                <body>
                  <!-- body of second unitary musical text -->
                </body>
              </music>
            </group>
            <back>

      </egXML>
      <div type="div4">
        <head>Grouped Texts</head>
        <p>The <gi>group</gi> element may be used to represent a collection of independent musical
          texts which is to be regarded as a single unit for processing or other purposes. It is
          provided to simplify the encoding of collections, anthologies, and cyclic works. It can
          also be used to record the potentially complex internal structure of corpora, covered more
          fully in chapter <ptr target="#corpus"/>.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="group"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>Examples of composite texts which may be represented using the <gi>group</gi> element
          include anthologies and other collections. The presence of common front matter referring
          to the whole collection, possibly in addition to front matter relating to each individual
          musical text, is a good indication that a given musical text might usefully be encoded in
          this way.</p>
        <p>For example, the overall structure of a collection of songs might be encoded as follows: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <music>
            <group>
              <music><!-- song 1 --></music>
              <music><!-- song 2 --></music>
              <!-- additional songs here -->
            </group>
          </music>
        </egXML>
        <p>A group of musical texts may contain unitary and grouped texts:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <music>
            <group>
              <music><!-- song 1 --></music>
              <group>
                <!-- songs sharing one or more characteristics, treated as a group -->
                <music><!-- song 2 --></music>
                <music><!-- song 3 --></music>
              </group>
            </group>
          </music>
        </egXML>
        <p>The <gi>group</gi> element may be used to encode any kind of collection in which the
          constituents are regarded by the encoder as works in their own right, such as <foreign>ad
            hoc</foreign> single- or multiple-composer collections or anthologies of works not
          originally conceived of as a single composition.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="div4">
        <head>Divisions of the Body</head>
        <p>This section describes sub-division of the body of a musical text. Front and back matter
          are described in chapter <ptr target="#text"/>.</p>
        <p>The body of a unitary musical text may contain one or more discrete, linear segments. The
          names commonly used for these structural subdivisions vary with the genre, style, and time
          period of the music, or even at the whim of the author, editor, or publisher. For example,
          a major subdivision of a symphony is generally referred to as a ‘movement’. An opera, on
          the other hand, is usually organized into ‘acts’ and then further by ‘scenes’. All such
          divisions are treated as occurrences of the same neutrally-named element, with an
          attribute <att>type</att> used to categorize them independently of their hierarchic
          level.</p>
        <p>The following element is used to identify musical subdivisions: </p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="mdiv"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>As a member of the class att.typed, the <gi>mdiv</gi> element has attributes which can be
          used to classify or sub-classify it.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="mdiv" atts="type subtype"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>To accommodate "divisions within divisions", an <gi>mdiv</gi> element may contain
          additional <gi>mdiv</gi> sub-elements nested to any level required. For example, the
          encoding of a symphony might have the following structure:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <body xmlns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei">
            <mdiv type="symphony">
              <mdiv type="movement" n="1">
                <!-- contents of mvt 1 -->
              </mdiv>
              <mdiv type="movement" n="2">
                <!-- contents of mvt 2 -->
              </mdiv>
              <mdiv type="movement" n="3">
                <!-- contents of mvt 3 -->
              </mdiv>
              <mdiv type="movement" n="4">
                <!-- contents of mvt 4 -->
              </mdiv>
            </mdiv>
          </body>
        </egXML>
        <p>while dramatic works, such as Verdi's opera, <title>Il Trovatore</title> often have a
          more deeply-nested structure:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <body>
            <mdiv type="opera">
              <mdiv type="act" n="I">
                <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act I, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act I, sc. 2--></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act I, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
              </mdiv>
              <mdiv type="act" n="II">
                <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 2 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="4"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 4 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="5"><!-- contents of act II, sc. 5 --></mdiv>
              </mdiv>
              <mdiv type="act" n="III">
                <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act III, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act III, sc. 2 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act III, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
              </mdiv>
              <mdiv type="act" n="IV">
                <mdiv type="scene" n="1"><!-- contents of act IV, sc. 1 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="2"><!-- contents of act IV, sc. 2 --></mdiv>
                <mdiv type="scene" n="3"><!-- contents of act IV, sc. 3 --></mdiv>
              </mdiv>
            </mdiv>
          </body>
        </egXML>
        <p>Conventionally, in performance the musical structures represented by <gi>mdiv</gi>
          elements are separated by pauses; however, <foreign>attacca</foreign>, <foreign>attacca
            subito</foreign>, <foreign>seque</foreign>, or similar terms are sometimes used at the
          end of an <gi>mdiv</gi> to indicate that the next <gi>mdiv</gi> should begin immediately
          after the conclusion of the current one.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="div4">
        <head>Content of Musical Divisions</head>
        <p>The <gi>mdiv</gi> element may contain one or both of two possible views: score and
          parts.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="score"/>
            <specDesc key="parts"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>Most often, the <gi>score</gi> element represents notation in which all the parts of an
          ensemble are arranged on vertically aligned staves, while the <gi>parts</gi> element
          collects the individually notated parts for each performer or group of performers. The
          explicit encoding of two views is often necessary because it is not always possible or
          desirable to automatically derive one view from the other. In addition, separating scores
          and parts can eliminate a great deal of markup complexity.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <body>
            <mdiv type="movement" n="1">
              <score>
                <!-- markup of score goes here -->
              </score>
              <parts>
                <!-- markup of performers’ parts goes here -->
              </parts>
            </mdiv>
            <!-- additional movements go here -->
          </body>
        </egXML>
        <p>Score and parts views may also be employed to accommodate different methods of organizing
          the markup – with no particular presentation implied. In this case, software may render a
          collection of parts as a score or a score as a collection of parts.</p>
        <p>Within the collective <gi>parts</gi> element, notation for a single performer is
          represented by the <gi>part</gi>element:</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="part"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>A <gi>part</gi> is effectively a miniature score requiring all the encoding features of a
          full score, such as multiple staves, performance directives, and so on. <gi>Part</gi>
          elements are useful for encoding performing parts when there is no score, such as in early
          music part books, or when the parts have non-aligning bar lines, or when different layout,
          such as page turns, are needed for the score and parts, or for accommodating software that
          requires part-by-part encoding. Please note that part elements in MEI are not an
          indication of voice leading. Voice leading can be encoded using the <att>next</att>
          attribute available on all event-type elements.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <parts>
            <part>
              <!-- first performer’s part -->
            </part>
            <part>
              <!-- second performer’s part -->
            </part>
            <!-- additional performers’ parts -->
          </parts>
        </egXML>
        <p>In both score and part views, the <gi>scoredef</gi> element is used to describe logical
          characteristics of the encoded music, such as key signature, the sounding key (as opposed
          to the notated key signature), meter, etc., and visual features, such as page size, staff
          groupings and labels, etc.</p>
        <p>A <gi>part</gi> or <gi>score</gi> may be further divided into linear segments called
          "sections".</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="section"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p><gi>Section</gi> elements often function as a scoping mechanism for clef signs, key and
          meter signatures, plus metronome, tempo, and expression markings. Their use minimizes the
          need for backward scanning to establish context when the starting point for access is not
          at the beginning of the score. <gi>Section</gi> elements may also be used for other
          user-defined, i.e., analytical or editorial, purposes, and so may be arbitrarily nested to
          any desired level.</p>
        <p>The <gi>ending</gi> element shares the same model as the <gi>section</gi> element; unlike
            <gi>section</gi>, however, it may not be recursively nested.</p>

        <p>The most common (non-analytical, non-editorial) use of <gi>section</gi> and
            <gi>ending</gi> elements is illustrated below:</p>

        <p>Within <gi>section</gi> elements, several methods of organization are possible, depending
          upon the notational style of the source material and the encoder's needs. For example,
          when the MEI.cmn module is used, the default organization is measure-by-measure, with
            <gi>staff</gi> and <gi>layer</gi> sub-elements within each <gi>measure</gi>. Further
          discussion of CMN notation is continued in chapter <ptr target="#cmn"/>.</p>
        <p>However, staff-by-staff organization is more appropriate for music without measures and
          is provided when either the MEI.mensural or MEI.neumes module is employed. Coverage of
          mensural notation is provided in chapter <ptr target="#mensural"/>, while <ptr
            target="#neumes"/> describes neumatic notation.</p>
        <p>It must be noted that, when both the MEI.cmn and MEI.mensural modules are available, it
          is possible to encode CMN notation without using <gi>measure</gi> elements; that is,
          staff-by-staff organization may be used and the ends of measures marked using
            <gi>barLine</gi> elements.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <!-- NEED EXAMPLE HERE! -->
        </egXML>
        <p>In certain circumstances, this approach may be preferable for reproduction of the visual
          layout of the music. However, the simultaneous use of the <gi>measure</gi> and
            <gi>barLine</gi> elements must be avoided.</p>
        <p>Typically, MEI follows the order of sections as they appear in the document being
          encoded. When performance requires a different order, for instance in the case of D.C. and
          D.S. directives, the following element may be used to define the performance order.</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="expansion"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>In the following example, <gi>expansion</gi> is used to indicate how the notated sections
          should be ordered in a "through-composed" rendition, for example for machine performance
          or analysis. The plist attribute contains an ordered list of identifiers of descendant
          &lt;section&gt;, &lt;ending&gt;, &lt;lem&gt;, or &lt;rdg&gt; elements. The sequence "#A #B
          #A" indicates that the section labelled 'A' comes first, then the section labelled 'B',
          followed by the 'A' section again. This mechanism must be specified independently of any
          textual directives, such as "Da capo" or "D.S. al Fine", that may be present in the
          document.</p>

        <p>The label and n attributes may be used to assign a name and number to an expansion, the

        <head>Front Matter</head>
        <p>By front matter we mean distinct sections of a text (usually, but not necessarily, a
          printed one), prefixed to it by way of introduction or identification as a part of its
          production. Features such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite
          case might be the prologue attached to a dramatic work. The front matter of an encoded
          text should not be confused with the MEI header described in chapter <ptr target="#header"
          />, which provides metadata for the entire file.</p>
        <p>An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text, if the original
          presentation of the work is of no interest, or for other reasons. No specific tags are
          provided for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear within front matter:
          instead, generic div (“division”) elements may be used, which should not be confused with
          mdiv (“musical division”) elements. The following suggested values for the <att>type</att> attribute
          may be used to distinguish various kinds of division characteristic of front matter: </p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>'preface' – A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or
            publisher explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text. </item>
          <item>'ack' – A formal declaration of acknowledgment by the author in which persons and
            institutions are thanked for their part in the creation of a text.</item>
          <item>'dedication' – A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or
            institutions by the author.</item>
          <item>'abstract' – A summary of the content of a text as continuous prose.</item>
          <item>'contents' – A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its
            constituents. The list element should be used to mark its structure.</item>
          <item>'frontispiece' – A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text.</item>
        </list>
        <p>The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the front matter of a
          text may be encoded. The front part begins with a title page, which is presented in
          section <!-\-XX,
        “Title Pages”-\->, below. This is followed by a dedication and a
          preface, each of which is encoded as a distinct div: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <titlePage><!-\- transcription of title page -\-></titlePage>
          <div type="dedication">

            <!-\- additional material -\->
          </div>
        </egXML>
        <p>The front matter concludes with another <gi>div</gi> element, shown in the next example,
          this time containing a table of contents, which contains a <gi>list</gi> element (as
          described in chapter <ptr target="#text"/><!-\- section 3.7 Lists -\->). Note the use of the
            <gi>ptr</gi> element to provide page-references: the implication here is that the target
          identifiers (song1, song2, etc.) will correspond with identifiers used for the
            <gi>mdiv</gi> elements containing the individual songs. (For a description of the
            <gi>ptr</gi> element, see chapter <!-\-XX, “Simple Links and Cross-References”-\->.) </p>

        <p>Detailed analysis of the title page and other preliminaries of older printed books and

          printed books; such analysis, however, requires a more detailed approach than the general

        <p>The physical rendition of title page information is often of considerable importance. One
          approach to this requirement would be to use the <gi>rend</gi> element, described in
          chapter <!-\-? -\-> to specify the rendition of each of the components of the title page.
          Another would be to employ a CSS stylesheet. Finally, a module customized for the
          description of typographic entities such as pages, lines, rules, etc., bearing
          special-purpose attributes to describe line-height, leading, degree of kerning, font, etc.
          could be employed. Further discussion of these issues is provided in chapter
